An absence, excused or unexcused, does not relieve a student of \nany course requirement. Regular class attendance is a student\u2019s obligation, as is a responsibility for \nall the work of class meetings, including tests and written tasks. Any unexcused absence or \nexcessive tardiness may result in a loss of participation points.  The use of cell phones, smart \nphones, or other mobile communication devices is disruptive, and is therefore prohibited during \nclass.  \nClass Recordings: \nClass sessions may be audio- and\/or video-recorded by the instructor for the purposes of student-\nparticipant reference and access by other students enrolled in the same course (including students \nenrolled in di \u01aferent class sections or break -out groups).  Students are not permitted to make \ntheir own recordings of class sessions or to share or distribute University recordings of class \nsessions.  NOTE: Students with speci\ufb01c electronic recording accommodations authorized by the \nO\u01afice of Disability Services ma y record classes; however, the instructor must be noti\ufb01ed of any \nsuch accommodation prior to recording. Any distribution of such recordings is prohibited. \nClass Absence(s): \nThe instructor has the authority to excuse a student\u2019s class absence(s) and to grant a student an \nacademic accommodation (turn in a late assignment, provide extra time on an assignment, \nreschedule an exam, etc.).  However, under Academic A \u01afairs Policy on Course Attendance and \nParticipation , University-sanctioned events or activities are considered excused absences.  A \nUniversity-sanctioned event or activity is one in which a student formally represents the University \nto external constituencies in athletic or academic activities. This policy does not supersede \nindividual program attendance and\/or participation requirements that are aligned with \naccreditation or licensure. For more information and student responsibilities to account for such an \nabsence, see provost.charlotte.edu\/policies-procedures\/academic-policies-and-\nprocedures\/course-attendance-and-participation . \nStudents are encouraged to work directly with their instructors regarding class absences for \nmedical appointments, military\/court orders, and\/or personal and family emergencies , such \nas a death in the immediate family, where a student is able to provide an instructor with appropriate \nsupporting documentation of the absence. The \ufb01nal decision for approval of absences and missed \nwork or make-up work is determined by the instructor. \nFor absences due to religious observances , students must provide the instructor with written \nnotice of requested accommodations no later than the 10th day of instruction for the semester. The \ninstructor and the student should then discuss what a reasonable accommodation should be in the \ngiven case and then document this agreed-upon accommodation. University Policy 409  provides \nmore details about this procedure. The O\u01afice of Civil Rights and Title IX  is available as a resource if \nstudents or faculty have questions about the process. The O\u01afice of Student Assistance and Support Services (SASS)  can provide noti\ufb01cation to faculty of \nemergency situations , when a student is unable to do so and when the o \u01afice has been made \naware of such emergencies. In such situations, the SASS o \u01afice may also be able to assist with \nveri\ufb01cation of such emergencies, once a student is able to return to classes. The SASS o \u01afice does \nnot provide veri\ufb01cation of absences for car trouble, weather issues, personal activities, work, \nweddings, vacations, or University-sponsored events. Absences related to such activities should be \ndiscussed directly with the faculty member. \nShould a student need assistance from the SASS o \u01afice in verifying an emergency situation, they \ncan submit an online request form  (sass.charlotte.edu\/services\/absence-veri\ufb01cation ) and attach \nsupporting documentation. Please note that students are not required to go through the SASS o \u01afice \nat any time regarding absence veri\ufb01cation, and the SASS o \u01afice does not have the authority to \nexcuse absences, allow for make-up work, or provide other academic accommodations. \nIn cases of absence due to pregnancy or parenting  (pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, \ntermination of pregnancy, or recovery from any of these conditions), students should contact the \nO\u01afice of Civil Rights and Title IX  to obtain absence veri\ufb01cation by completing the online form  \nat http:\/\/bit.ly\/332eaGd . \nDisability Accommodations: \nStudents in this course seeking accommodations to disabilities must \ufb01rst consult with the O\u01afice of \nDisability Services  and follow the instructions of that o \u01afice for obtaining accommodations.  \nNon-discrimination: \nAll students and the instructor are expected to engage with each other respectfully.   Unwelcome \nconduct directed toward another person based upon that person\u2019s actual or perceived race, actual \nor perceived gender, color, religion, age, national origin, ethnicity, disability, or veteran status, or for \nany other reason, may constitute a violation of University Policy 406, The Code of Student \nResponsibility . Any student suspected of engaging in such conduct will be referred to the O \u01afice of \nStudent Conduct. \nAcademic Integrity: \nAll students are required to read and abide by the Code of Student Academic Integrity. Violations of \nthe Code of Student Academic Integrity, including plagiarism, will result in disciplinary action as \nprovided in the Code. De\ufb01nitions and examples of plagiarism are set forth in the Code and on the \nStudent Accountability & Con\ufb02ict Resolution website . The Code is available from the Dean of \nStudents O \u01afice or online at legal.charlotte.edu\/policies\/up-407 .  Additional resources are available \non the Student Accountability & Con\ufb02ict Resolution website . \nFaculty may ask students to produce identi\ufb01cation at examinations and may require students to \ndemonstrate that graded assignments completed outside of class are their own work. \nCopyright: \nLectures and course materials, including presentations, tests, exams, outlines, and similar \nmaterials, are protected by copyright.

the fundamental knowledge andskills required in the field of computer vision, with a focus on applications in data science. In the pastdecade, there has been exponential growth in the volume of visual data available for analysis anddecision making. Deep learning-based computer vision techniques offer powerful tools for extractinginformation and insights from visual data, and have become a core component of modern dataanalytics and AI implementations across industries. This course aims to bridge the gap betweentheory and practice, and will provide students with a blend of core theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in processing, manipulating, modeling, and analyzing vision-based data through deeplearning. Through a mix of in-class labs, homework assignments, and a project, students will learn toimplement these techniques across a range of real-world problems using Python and PyTorch. By theend of the course, students will have gained a foundational understanding of computer vision,expertise in working with deep learning frameworks, and expanded their data-science toolbox to beable to apply computer vision techniques effectively in their future work \/ research. Instructional MethodMaterials presented in this course will be covered through lectures and labs. Key topics will beexplored through hands-on application in Python \/ PyTorch. Students will gain both the theoreticalunderstanding of computer vision concepts, as well as the experience of putting such concepts andtechniques into practice.

Failure to attend or to arrive ontime can adversely affect both individual performance, ability to contribute to the group project, andthe earned letter grade. If a student misses a class due to work or other reasons, it is theirresponsibility to get notes from peers; instructors do not hold extra repeat class sessions. Studentswill be allowed to miss no more than 3 classes without affecting their final grade. For every 3absences the final grade will be lowered by one letter grade. Grade Discussions: The instructor will discuss grades only in person (and not via telephone or e-mail)and only with the student (not with parents, spouses, etc). Office hours are listed in the syllabus. Electronic Devices: Students are not allowed to use any electronic devices during the class, unlessotherwise instructed by the instructor.

Introductory and advanced readings for the course will be drawn \nfrom science,  technology, and society; gender, bodies, and technology, disability studies; \nsociology; philosophy of technology, ensuring that students have the grounding framework to \ndelve into deeper questions about how technologies get constructed, and why certain pr oblems \nseem to recur in technoscientific fields, at multiple points in history.  \nWhy do facial recognition systems have problems with certain features and movements? \nWhy can\u2019t autonomous vehicles recognize wheelchair users? Why do some people think there\u2019s  \na particular \u201cright kind\u201d of mind or body? In this course, we will examine the historical \nfoundations of all of these questions and more, as well as case studies where they have played \nout in the real lives of humans, today, with life or death results. We  will then ask what it means \nthat automated and algorithmic systems are being built to emulate and replicate these situations, \nand what researchers are doing, or could be doing better, to address this.  \nStudents will be assessed on class participation , a se lf-created assignment plan, and leading \nat least one reading discussion, in person or online. This allows students who don\u2019t want to speak \nin front of others, for whatever reason, to nevertheless have opportunities to refine their \nunderstanding of the mate rial by preparing to teach it to others. Each student will also create one \nfinal project, to the parameters of their choice, as approved by me.  \n \n  Learning Outcomes  \nUpon completion of this course, students should be able to:  \n\u2022 Describe, compare, and contrast several distinct perspectives as to whether and how \nbeliefs and values affect the production of knowledge and technology  \n\u2022 Recognize and discuss the historical and philosophical foundations algorithms and \nartificial intelligence.  \n\u2022 Examine and articul ate major themes in disability studies, philosophy of technology, \nSTS, and GBT.  \n\u2022 Critically e ngage their own views of how knowledge, values , and belief  impact the \ncreation of technology .  \n \nGrading  \nDiscussions 25%:  25% of your grade will be accounted for in Discussions. Each week you will \nparticipate in a discussion of the week's materials either in class, on the weekly discussion \nboards , or both. Additionally, you will sign up to lead or co -lead at least one week\u2019s class . \n \nChoose Your Own Adventure  \u2014 75%  Total:  \nAs part of this class, you\u2019ll c reate a plan of study from this menu that amounts to 7 50 points of \nactivities (listed below). When I grade, 750 points = 100%, 675 points = 90%, 600 points = 80%, \netc. Please submit your plan by February 2  for approval  so that you can b e graded accordingly \nthroughout the semester. Remember: you can do multiples of some of these items.  \nHere's one example of a potential adventure plan:  \n \n300 points GPT Process  + 225 points for 2 Book Reviews + 150 points Book Presentation + 75 \npoints Questi ons = 750 points.  \n \nProject Options  \nQuestions  75 pts : Please bring at least two questions to class each week. You can submit these \nby email prior to class or turn them in on a sheet of paper. We will visit some of the questions \nduring class or pick up on them later in the semester. I will grade your question s for 10 class \nperiods (10 points each \/ 5 points per question) to add up to 100 points.  \n \nBook Presentation  150 pts each : You can do more than one  of these. You'll read a book and \ngive a critical summary and explanation of it to the class. Presentations wi ll be about 15 -20 \nminutes, and the class can ask you questions afterward. Run the book by your professor for \napproval first. The book could be fictional as long as it presents ideas relevant to this class.  \n \nBook Review  112.5 pts each :  You can do more tha n one, and you can approach a book review \neditor if there's a book you'd like to review for some journal.  You'll read a scholarly book and \nsubmit a book review (like what you would find in a scholarly journal). Book reviews should be \nshort, but detailed. *** Class\/work -hack: You can do a Book Presentation and a Book Review on \nthe same book, and then also use class feedback to get your book review ready to send to a book \nreview editor of a scholarly journal.***  \n \nSyllabus Creation  300 pts: You can create a sy llabus that you could imagine yourself teaching \nfor a course on any theme that strongly intersects with the material in this course. Your syllabus should not be the same as mine is here. Consider grading, the structure of content, the frequency \nof class me eting, the pace of the course, the technology you'll use. After creating this syllabus \nand turning it in (by  April 5 ), you will make an appointment with your instructor for a \nconversation about your choices. Ideally, this feedback will help you think about  what you might \nteach and how you might teach in the future. A final version of this syllabus will be due by the \nend of the semester.  \n \nDue to gross ethical mismanagement by OpenAI, I'm removing this experimentation option \nfrom the syllabus, and I'll be replacing it with something else. Details TK . \nChat GPT 300 pts : Generate a Chat GPT output on one or more themes or topics  related to \ndisability, technology, and artif icial intelligence , and then expand on and correct the output with \nspecific references and citations from our class readings and lectures. Your full submission will \nconsist of  \no The prompt you used ; \no The original GPT output ; \no Your corrections  of the GPT output ; \no And your reflections on what it got wrong or otherwise failed to do.  \n \nChoose Your Own Project: Propose the percentage points and activity . You could propose \nto write a short story exploring some class -related theme, do a group project ( if you can convince \nyour peers), give a special class presentation, create a multi -media something, shoot a short \ndocumentary, provide a scholarly review, write a standard research paper, etc. See your \ninstructor to discuss your idea.

I strongly suggest taking notes. \nPowerPoint slides will be posted on Canvas right  before  class.  \nSoftware  \nVarious libraries of R scripting.  \nWi-Fi Enabled  Device  \nYou must have a Wi -Fi enabled laptop and bring it to class. This will help you follow the \nlectures and take notes. Also, tutorials and exercises will be conducted in class.  \n 4 \n  \n \nIn-class exercise s (10 points  in total ) and homework assignments (40 points in \ntotal)  \nThe course includes in -class exercises and homework assignments. D ata and instructions  \nwill be  available on Canvas.  Homework  assignments will need to be complete d on your \nown time and individually. Homework a nswers will need to be turned in on Canvas one \nweek later . \nFinal  exam  \nThe questions are from the slides, lectures that I give during sessions.  The final exam will be \nbased on material presented after the mid-term exam . The experience  shows those who take \nnotes during the class get the best results in exams.  \nFinal  project  (100  points)  \nEach  student  is responsible  for turning  in a final  project  that  applies  concepts\/tools  that \nyou learned through the semester . The purpose of the project is to gain exposure to \ngeospatial analytical  research  and application.  You  will produce  your  own  research  \nquestions,  source  your own data, conduct geospatial analysis in R , and produce high \nquality maps\/graphs to communicate  your results. Students will work individually. The \ntasks for the final project are as follows:  \n\u25cf A 1-page  proposal  (double -spaced)  describing  the idea  of your  final  project  (due: \n2\/23\/2023 ).

Students  are \nexpected to read the rubrics to be aware of the criteria I have for grading the project.  \n \nGrading  \n Course  Assignments\/Assessments  5 \n Task  Grade  points  \nMidterm  exam  50 points total  \nFinal  exam  50 points total  \nIn-class assignments  10 points total  \nHomework  assignment s 40 points  total  \nFinal  project  100 points total  \nTotal  250 points  \nScale:  A: 225 -250 , B: 200 -224 , C: 175 -199 , D: 150 -174 , F<174 \n \n \nAttendance  \nStudents are expected to attend every class. I  do not include everything in slides, so you \nmay not be able to answer all exam questions only by going over slides (a good reason to \navoid missing a class). If you are absent please be responsible to obtain notes from your \nclassmates. Please be respectful of other classmates and arrive and leave the class on time.  \nCommunication  Statement  \nI usually answer emails as soon as I can, but leave one day to he ar back from me. TA \noffice  is McEniry  411A  on the main campus . Please contact Faizeh to schedule a meeting in \nMcEniry or in the Center City  building . Zoom meetings with me as well as with Faizeh are \npossible. Please plan ahead of time for this.  \nLate  Assignment  Policy  \nLate  assignments  will be penalized  as follows:  \n\u2022 Up to one day late (24h):  -25%  \n\u2022 2 day late:  -50%  \n\u2022 More  than  2 days  late: No  longer  accepted  \nPlease  try to plan  ahead  if you have  another  commitment.  In the case  of a medical condition,  \nplease  provide  proof  from  a doctor or clinic.  I will ignore  only  the first  time  that  you submit \nyour  assignment  late.   \nClass  behavior  \n(1) Please  turn  off and put away  your  cell phone  before  entering  the classroom.  \n \n(2) Do not use the computers during lectures to browse the internet, check your social \nmedia account, watch sports, do homework for other classes, or play games. After \nan initial warning,  you will be  asked  to leave the  classroom.  It is very  distracting  for \neveryone.  Course  Policies  6 \n (3) In case  you are waiting  for an emergency  call, reach  out to me before  the class  \nand we will handle the situation  \n(4) Why do I have this policy? The assumption is you are coming to class to learn \nnew materials. Paying attention is the first requirement of learning.  Studies \nshow that using  of cellphone s (even if it is on the  desk) or  other  electronic \ndevices open space for  distraction.  Since  we use the cellphones  a lot, sometimes  it \nis just habitual  to use them. Refrain from using your phone at all during class \ntime.  \n \n \n \nEthics  \nIf you are contemplating  an ethical  failure  please  read  the code  of student  academic  \nintegrity: http:\/\/www.legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/ps -105.html , so you can plan for the \nconsequences. Students  are encouraged  to work  on their  own, but  helping  each  other  \nunderstand  concepts is fine. In other words, you may work with other students on lab \nassignments but you may not copy projects or written answers to questions from another \nstudent. Examples of unacceptable actions that will warrant a phone call to the dean of \nstudent\u2019s office:  \n\u25cf Turning  in assignments  with  answers  to written  questions  that  are identical  to \nanother student in the class. All words and thoughts should be your own  \n\u25cf Turning  in assignmen ts from  students  from  past  semesters  \n \nWithdrawals  \nStudents are expected to complete all courses for which they are registered at the close of \nthe add\/drop period. If students are concerned about succeeding in the course, it is \nimportant to make an appointm ent to speak with the course instructor as soon as possible. \nThe University  policy  on withdrawal  allows  students  only  a limited  number  of \nopportunities available to withdraw from courses. It is important for students to \nunderstand the financial and academic consequences that may result from course \nwithdrawals. The UNC Charlotte Academy Policy on Withdrawals for Undergraduate \nstudents is available from the Office of the Provost or online at:  \nhttp:\/\/provost.uncc.edu\/policies\/withdrawal  \n \nStudents  with  disabilities  \nStudents  in this course  seeking  accommodations  to disabilities  must  first  consult  with  the \nOffice of Disabilities Services ( http:\/\/www.ds.uncc.edu  or 704 -687 -0040) and follow the \ninstructions of that office for obtaining accommodations.  University  Policies  7 \n Religious  Accommodations  Policy  \nUNC Charlotte provides reasonable accommodations, including a minimum of two excused \nabsences each academic yea r, for religious observances required by a student\u2019s religious \npractice or belief.  Such reasonable accommodations must be requested in accordance with \nthe procedures in this Policy, and include the opportunity for the student to make up any \ntests or other work missed due to an excused absence for a religious observance.  Students \nwishing to request a religious accommodation may refer to the information found at \nhttp:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/ps -134.html . \n \nOnline  Student  Course  Evaluation  Process  and Confidentiality  \nCourses are evaluated through an online evaluation survey process. Student course \nevaluations  provide  an important  source  of feedback  for faculty  regarding  course  design  \nand instructional  effectiveness.  The online  course  evaluations  are administered  at the end \nof the term, during the final two week (prior to final exams). You will receive an email \nannouncement alerting you when the survey period opens. Periodic reminders will be sent \nduring the time the survey is open. Please be advised that this process is secure and \nconfidential. The technology used ensures anonymity of participants as well as \nconfidentiality. The School of Data Science  is committed to excellent instruction a nd \nstudent support.  Please  help  in continuing  this commitment  by participating  in the course  \nevaluation process.  \n  8 \n  \n \nWeek  Date  Lecture  Notice  \n1 1\/10\/2023  Course Outline  \nIntro to GIS\/geospatial data analytics  \nFundamentals of GIS (1)   \n2 1\/17\/2023  Fundamentals of GIS  (2) \nR tutorial   \n3 1\/24\/2023  Datum  and coordinate  systems  \nMap projections   \n4 1\/31\/2023  Symbolizing features  \nMapping and geovisualization   \n5 2\/7\/2023  Vector data model  \nVector data manipulation   \n6 2\/14\/2023  Understanding  spatial  queries  \nTopology  and topological  relationships   \n7 2\/21\/2023  Mid -term exam  \nData uncertainty and accuracy   \n8 2\/28\/2023  Student  Recess - No classes   \n9 3\/7\/2023  Spatial  data  collection -Global  Positioning  \nSystems (GPS)   \n10 3\/14\/2023  Spatial  analysis  of vector  data   \n11 3\/21\/2023  One -on-one meetings re. project  \nGeocoding  and georeferencing   \n12 3\/28\/2023  Catch -up or cancelled class   \n13 4\/4\/2023  Network  analysis   \n14 4\/11\/2023  Spatial  interpolation &  point  patterns   \n15 4\/18\/2023  Hot spot detection  \nSpatial and space -time clustering   \n16 4\/25\/2023  Spatial  Autocorrelation   \n17 5\/2\/2023  FINAL EXAM   \n 5\/9\/2023  Project Presentations @ 5 -7pm   \n \n Tentative  course  schedule  (subject  to updates)  ","course_title":"Geospatial Data Analytics","course_number":"6010","instructor":"Jean Claude Thill","semester":"Spring 2023","section":""},{"link":"https:\/\/dsba.charlotte.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/719\/2024\/10\/DSBA-6010-Model-Risk-Management-Fall-2024-Robert-Fox.pdf","filename":"DSBA-6010-Model-Risk-Management-Fal","parent":"https:\/\/dsba.charlotte.edu\/2024\/10\/10\/dsba-6010-special-topic-model-risk-management-fall-2024-robert-fox\/","title":"DSBA 6010 Special Topic: Model Risk Management, Fall 2024 \u2013 Robert Fox","content":"DSBA 6010 - Special Topic: Model Risk Management \n \nThe purpose of this syllabus is to set out policies and expectations for the course.  Syllabus policies \nand expectations are intended to create a productive learning atmosphere for all students.  The \nsyllabus may change over the course of the semester; and all such changes will be noted in class \nand announced via Canvas announcements (which should go to your UNC Charlotte email). \nCourse Prerequisites:  \nSTAT 3122 and STAT 3123, or by permission of department.  DSBA 6156 (Applied Machine Learning). \nTextbook:  \nThere is no required textbook for this course. \nSoftware:  \nYou may use any software to begin the semester. However you are expected to be able to code \neverything in Python by the end of the semester. The group project must be coded in Python. \nCourse Description:  \nThis course provides students a survey of major risk elements in quantitative predictive modeling. \nBasic steps and considerations in developing models are discussed, including topics such as \nperformance measures, variable screening, transformation, and selection. The focus of the course \nis however placed on \ufb01nding ways to improve models to better control risks. Topics discussed \ninclude causality, over-\ufb01tting\/under-\ufb01tting, local and global interpretability and explainability, \npermutation, global sensitivity, global importance, partial dependence, LIME and SHAP, integrated \ngradient method, robustness, boundary perturbation, reliability, variability, conformability, \nresilience, natural language processing, fairness, etc. \nCourse Objectives:  \nAs a counterpart of model development, model validation takes on an increasingly important role in \ncontrolling quantitative model risks, in a broadened risk environment. Model risk management is a \ncomplex \ufb01eld of study consisting of concepts and techniques across a wide spectrum. The primary \nobjective of this course is to give students an introductory exposure to the foundation of model risk \ncontrol via model validation. \nCourse Schedule (subject to change): \nDate Section \nWeek 1 Intro to Model Validation and  Risk Management and Validation  \nWeek 2 Data: A Model's Foundation  \nOutlier Detection and Treatment Missing Value Treatment  \nEncoding, Scaling, and Transformation \nDimensionality Reduction \nWeek 3 Generalized Linear Models  \nData Splitting \nVariable Selection and Variable Transformation\/Encoding  \nMulticollinearity: Checking and Mitigation \nModel Training and Performance Assessment \nWeek 4 Machine Learning Models  \nReview of Machine Learning: Tree-Based (Random Forest and Gradient \nBoosting Machine) \nReview of Machine Learning: Neural Networks (FFNN and Deep Learning) \nHyperparameter Optimization \nWeek 5 Conceptual Soundness: Model Explainability  \nPost hoc methods: Variable Importance (PFI), Global Explainability, Local \nExplainability \nWeek 6 Inherently Interpretable \/ Explainable Models  \nModel Robustness and Regularization \nBias and Variance \nWeek 7 Model Diagnostics & Error Analysis  \nPerformance Degradation and Model Weakness Identi\ufb01cation \nModel Segmentation and Improvement \nWeek 8 Model Governance and Risk Management Strategies \nWeek 9 Introduction to Natural Language Processing & Embeddings \nWeek 10  Introduction to Large Language Models \nWeek 11  Metrics and Analysis of LLMs \nWeek 12  LLMs: Risk Management and Governance  \nWeek 13+  Final Project Workshops & Final Pr esentations    \nAttendance: \nStudents are expected to attend every class and remain in class for the duration of the session. \nFailure to attend class or arriving late may impact your ability to achieve course objectives, which \ncould a\u01afect your course grade.  An absence, excused or unexcused, does not relieve a student of \nany course requirement. Regular class attendance is a student\u2019s obligation, as is a responsibility for \nall the work of class meetings, including tests and written tasks. Any unexcused absence or \nexcessive tardiness may result in a loss of participation points.  The use of cell phones, smart \nphones, or other mobile communication devices is disruptive, and is therefore prohibited during \nclass.  \nClass Recordings: \nClass sessions will all be audio- and\/or video-recorded for the purposes of student-participant \nreference and access by other students enrolled in the same course (including students enrolled in \ndi\u01aferent class sections or break -out groups).  Students are not permitted to make their own \nrecordings of class sessions or to share or distribute University recordings of class sessions. NOTE: \nStudents with speci\ufb01c electronic recording accommodations authorized by the O \u01afice of Disability \nServices may record classes; however, the instructor must be noti\ufb01ed of any such accommodation \nprior to recording. Any distribution of such recordings is prohibited. \nClass Absence(s): \nThe instructor has the authority to excuse a student\u2019s class absence(s) and to grant a student an \nacademic accommodation (turn in a late assignment, provide extra time on an assignment, \nreschedule an exam, etc.).  However, under Academic A \u01afairs Policy on Course Attendance and \nParticipation , University-sanctioned events or activities are considered excused absences.  A \nUniversity-sanctioned event or activity is one in which a student formally represents the University \nto external constituencies in athletic or academic activities. This policy does not supersede \nindividual program attendance and\/or participation requirements that are aligned with \naccreditation or licensure. For more information and student responsibilities to account for such an \nabsence, see provost.charlotte.edu\/policies-procedures\/academic-policies-and-\nprocedures\/course-attendance-and-participation . \nStudents are encouraged to work directly with their instructors regarding class absences for \nmedical appointments, military\/court orders, and\/or personal and family emergencies , such \nas a death in the immediate family, where a student is able to provide an instructor with appropriate \nsupporting documentation of the absence. The \ufb01nal decision for approval of absences and missed \nwork or make-up work is determined by the instructor. \nFor absences due to religious observances , students must provide the instructor with written \nnotice of requested accommodations no later than the 10th day of instruction for the semester. The \ninstructor and the student should then discuss what a reasonable accommodation should be in the \ngiven case and then document this agreed-upon accommodation. University Policy 409  provides \nmore details about this procedure. The O\u01afice of Civil Rights and Title IX  is available as a resource if \nstudents or faculty have questions about the process. The O\u01afice of Student Assistance and Support Services (SASS)  can provide noti\ufb01cation to faculty of \nemergency situations , when a student is unable to do so and when the o \u01afice has been made \naware of such emergencies. In such situations, the SASS o \u01afice may also be able to assist with \nveri\ufb01cation of such emergencies, once a student is able to return to classes. The SASS o \u01afice does \nnot provide veri\ufb01cation of absences for car trouble, weather issues, personal activities, work, \nweddings, vacations, or University-sponsored events. Absences related to such activities should be \ndiscussed directly with the faculty member. \nShould a student need assistance from the SASS o \u01afice in verifying an emergency situation, they \ncan submit an online request form  (sass.charlotte.edu\/services\/absence-veri\ufb01cation ) and attach \nsupporting documentation. Please note that students are not required to go through the SASS o \u01afice \nat any time regarding absence veri\ufb01cation, and the SASS o \u01afice does not have the authority to \nexcuse absences, allow for make-up work, or provide other academic accommodations. \nIn cases of absence due to pregnancy or parenting  (pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, \ntermination of pregnancy, or recovery from any of these conditions), students should contact the \nO\u01afice of Civil Rights and Title IX  to obtain absence veri\ufb01cation by completing the online form  \nat http:\/\/bit.ly\/332eaGd . \nDisability Accommodations: \nStudents in this course seeking accommodations to disabilities must \ufb01rst consult with the O\u01afice of \nDisability Services  and follow the instructions of that o \u01afice for obtaining accommodations.  \nNon-discrimination: \nAll students and the instructor are expected to engage with each other respectfully.   Unwelcome \nconduct directed toward another person based upon that person\u2019s actual or perceived race, actual \nor perceived gender, color, religion, age, national origin, ethnicity, disability, or veteran status, or for \nany other reason, may constitute a violation of University Policy 406, The Code of Student \nResponsibility . Any student suspected of engaging in such conduct will be referred to the O \u01afice of \nStudent Conduct. \nAcademic Integrity: \nAll students are required to read and abide by the Code of Student Academic Integrity. Violations of \nthe Code of Student Academic Integrity, including plagiarism, will result in disciplinary action as \nprovided in the Code. De\ufb01nitions and examples of plagiarism are set forth in the Code and on the \nStudent Accountability & Con\ufb02ict Resolution website . The Code is available from the Dean of \nStudents O \u01afice or online at legal.charlotte.edu\/policies\/up-407 .  Additional resources are available \non the Student Accountability & Con\ufb02ict Resolution website . \nFaculty may ask students to produce identi\ufb01cation at examinations and may require students to \ndemonstrate that graded assignments completed outside of class are their own work. \nCopyright: \nLectures and course materials, including presentations, tests, exams, outlines, and similar \nmaterials, are protected by copyright.

Please read the entire syllabus carefully before continuing \nin this course. These policies and expectations are intended to crea te a productive learning \natmosphere for all students. Unless you are prepared to abide by these policies and \nexpectations, you risk losing the opportunity to participate further in the course.  \n \nThe standards and requirements set forth in this syllabus may be modified at any time by the \ncourse instructor. Notice of such changes will be by announcement in class.  \n \nI will conduct this class in an atmosphere of mutual respect. I encourage your active \nparticipation in class discussions. Each of us may have strongly differing opinions on the \nvarious topics of class discussions. The conflict of ideas is encouraged and we lcome. The \norderly questioning of the ideas of others, including mine, is similarly welcome. However, I will \nexercise my responsibility to manage the discussions so that ideas and argument can proceed \nin an orderly fashion. You should expect that if your c onduct during class discussions seriously \ndisrupts the atmosphere of mutual respect I expect in this class, you will not be permitted to \nparticipate further.  \n \nAll students and the instructor are expected to engage with each other respectfully. \nUnwelcome conduct directed toward another person based upon that person\u2019s actual or \nperceived race, actual or perceived gender, color, religion, age, national origin, ethn icity, \ndisability, or veteran status, or for any other reason, may constitute a violation of University \nPolicy 406, The Code of Student Responsibility. Any student suspected of engaging in such \nconduct will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct.   BUILDING AND LEADING DATA ORGANIZATIONS  \nSyllabus  \n 6  \nAttendance  \nAttendance: Students are expected to attend every class and remain in class for the duration \nof the session. Failure to attend class or arriving late may impact your ability to achieve course \nobjectives, which could affect your course grade. An absence, excused or unexcused, does \nnot relieve a student of any course requirement. Regular cl ass attendance is a student\u2019s \nobligation, as is a responsibility for all the work of class meetings, including tests and written \ntasks. Any unexcused absence or excessive tardiness may result in a loss of participation \npoints.  \n \nClass Absence(s): The instructor has the authority to excuse a student\u2019s class absence(s) and \nto grant a student an academic accommodation (turn in a late assignment, provide extra time \non an assignment, reschedule an exam, etc.). However, under Academic Affairs Policy on \nCours e Attendance and Participation, University -sanctioned events or activities are considered \nexcused absences. A University -sanctioned event or activity is one in which a student formally \nrepresents the University to external constituencies in athletic or aca demic activities. This \npolicy does not supersede individual program attendance and\/or participation requirements \nthat are aligned with accreditation or licensure. For more information and student \nresponsibilities to account for such an absence, see provost .charlotte.edu\/policies -\nprocedures\/academic -policies -and-procedures\/course -attendance -and-participation.  \n \nStudents are encouraged to work directly with their instructors regarding class absences for \nmedical appointments, military\/court orders, and\/or personal and family emergencies, such as \na death in the immediate family, where a student can provide an instructor with appropriate \nsupporting documentation of the absence. The final decision for approval of absences and \nmissed work or make -up work is determined by the instructor.  \n \nFor absences due to religious observances, students must provide the instructor with written \nnotice of requested accommodations no later than the 10th day of instruction for the semester. \nThe instructor and the student should then discuss what a reasonable  accommodation should \nbe in the given case and then document this agreed -upon accommodation. University Policy \n409 provides more details about this procedure. The Office of Civil Rights and Title IX is \navailable as a resource if students or faculty have qu estions about the process.  \n  BUILDING AND LEADING DATA ORGANIZATIONS  \nSyllabus  \n 7 The Office of Student Assistance and Support Services (SASS) can provide notification to \nfaculty of emergency situations, when a student is unable to do so and when the office has \nbeen made aware of such emergencies. In such situations, the SASS office may  also be able \nto assist with verification of such emergencies, once a student is able to return to classes. The \nSASS office does not provide verification of absences for car trouble, weather issues, personal \nactivities, work, weddings, vacations, or Univer sity-sponsored events. Absences related to \nsuch activities should be discussed directly with the faculty member.  \n \nShould a student need assistance from the SASS office in verifying an emergency situation, \nthey can submit an online request form (sass.charlotte.edu\/services\/absence -verification) and \nattach supporting documentation. Please note that students are not requ ired to go through the \nSASS office at any time regarding absence verification, and the SASS office does not have the \nauthority to excuse absences, allow for make -up work, or provide other academic \naccommodations.  \n \nIn cases of absence due to pregnancy or parenting (pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, \ntermination of pregnancy, or recovery from any of these conditions), students should contact \nthe Office of Civil Rights and Title IX to obtain absence verification b y completing the online \nform at http:\/\/bit.ly\/332eaGd.  \n \nIf I am late in arriving to class, you must wait a full 20 minutes after the start of class before \nyou may leave without being counted absent, or you must follow any written instructions I may \ngive you about my anticipated tardiness.  \n \nHours  \nThis 3 -credit course requires three hours of classroom or direct faculty instruction and six \nhours of out -of-class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks. Out -of-class work \nmay include but is not limited to: required reading, library research, w ritten assignments, and \nstudying for quizzes and exams  \n \nCopyright  \nMy lectures and course materials, including presentations, tests, exams, outlines, and similar \nmaterials, are protected by copyright. I am the exclusive owner of copyright in those materials I \ncreate. I encourage you to take notes and make copies of course  materials for your own  BUILDING AND LEADING DATA ORGANIZATIONS  \nSyllabus  \n 8 educational use.

I do \nnot discuss individual student grades over email and do not negotiate \ngrades . \nExams:  \u2022 There are no exams for this course.  \nQuizzes \/In-class \nAssignments : \u2022 There will be short quizzes at various points in the semester on topics \ncovered prior. There may also be in -class assignments.  \n\u2022 You must complete each assignment on your own.  Any sharing \nbetween students will be considered a violation of the Academic Integrity \nCode and will result in a minimum  grade of zero for the assignment with \na possibility for further disciplinary action.   \n \n \n \n\u2022 All changes in assignments or schedules will be posted on Canvas. It is \nyour responsibility to keep up with the changes that are posted on \nCanvas.  \nGroup Proj ect: \u2022 The key tenet of this course is the use of data as a strategic resource.  \nMore directly, how the knowledge of analytical methodologies\/tools \ncombined with an understanding of how companies leverage data \nresults in competitive advantage.  Your group wil l be asked to think \ncritically about real -world, complex business problems\/questions and \nhow data science and business analytics can be used to solve them . \nGroups will then research and analyze 1) an opportunity and 2) a \nsolution using big data to provide a competitive advantage .  Full details \nwill be provided later in the semester.  \nCourse \nPreparation:  \u2022 Students are expected to study the  posted materials ( articles, cases, \nnotes, presentations, etc.) prior to each respective  session and be ready \nto answer questions related to the current topics.  \nClass \nAttendance:  \u2022 A 2010 meta -analysis  found  that \"class attendance is a better \npredictor of college grades than any other known predictor of \nacademic performance.\"  \n\u2022 That said, I do not take attendance.  I\u2019ll explain why  in our first class \u2026 \n\u2022 Students are expected to attend class and remain  for the duration of the \nsession . Failure to attend  may impact your ability to achieve course \nobjectives which could affect your course grade.  An absence, excused \nor unexcused, does not relieve a student of any course requirement. \nRegular class attendance is a student\u2019s obligation, as is the \nresponsibility for all the work of class meetings, including tests and \nwritten tasks.  \n\u2022 If you earn an F or U  grade, your last date of attendance will be reported. \nThis may require you to pay back any financial aid money received for \nthis course.  \n\u2022 Only absences verified and communicated to the Professor by the \nUniversity\u2019s Student Assistance and Support Services  will be \nexcused.  \n\u2022 Students are expected to attend every class and remain in class for the \nduration of the session.  Arriving late to class or leaving early  will \nlower  your ability to achieve course objectives.   \n\u2022 An absence, excused or unexcused, does not relieve a student of any \ncourse requirement. Regular class attendance is a student's obligation, \nas is a responsibility for all the work of class meetings, including tests \nand written tasks.  \nLeadership in the \nClassroom:  \u2022 The class will be conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect . \nYou are encouraged to have active participation in class discussions. \nEach of us may have strongly differing opinions  on the various topics of \nclass discussions. The conflict of ideas is encouraged and welcome. The \norderly questioning of the ideas of others, including the instructor, is \nsimilarly welcome. However, the instructor will exercise responsibility to \nmanage the  discussions so that ideas and argument s can proceed in an \norderly fashion. You should expect that if your conduct during class  \n \n \n \ndiscussions seriously disrupts the atmosphere of mutual respect, you will \nnot be permitted to participate further, and your grad e will be impacted.  \n\u2022 Do not forward course emails or documents of any form  to those \noutside of the course without the knowledge and\/or permission of the \ninstructor.  \n\u2022 Do not email the instructor a copy and paste of quiz questions, \ncanvas screenshots, or discu ssion questions from Canvas or other \nsources.  If you have questions, see the instructor in person during office \nhours or by appointment.  \nElectronic \nDevices in Class : \u2022 The use of cell phones, smartphones, or other mobile \ncommunication devices is disruptive and is therefore prohibited \nduring class  unless being used as a part  of and approved through \ndisability services  or at the instructor\u2019s discretion. Except in \nemergencies, those using such devices must leave the classroom for the \nremainder of the  class period.  \n\u2022 Computers, smartphones, or smartwatches are prohibited during \nexaminations.   \n\u2022 Electronic video and\/or audio recording is not permitted during \nclass unless the student obtains permission from the instructor. If \npermission is granted, any distribution of the recording is prohibited. \nStudents with specific electronic recording accommodations authorized \nby the Office of Disability Services do not require instructor permission; \nhowever, the instructor must be notified of any such accommodation  \nprior to recording. Any distribution of such recordings is prohibited.  \nGrade Appeals \nPolicy : \n \u2022 If you believe that the grade you received on an assignment or an exam \nwas in error or unfair, you can appeal to the professor in writing \nwithin 7 calendar days  after the grades are posted.  The appeal \nshould clearly state the reasons why you believe the grade to be unfair \nor the nature of the error. Overdue appeals will not be considered.  \nStudent \nAcademic \nIntegrity:  \u2022 All students are required to read and abide by  the Code of Student \nAcademic Integrity . Violations of the Code of Student Academic Integrity, \nincluding plagiarism, will result in disciplinary action as provided in t he \nCode. Definitions and examples of plagiarism are set forth in the Code. \nThe Code is available from the Dean of Students Office or online . \n\u2022 Faculty may ask students to produce identification at examinations and \nmay require students to demonstrate that graded assignments \ncompleted outside of class are their own work.  \nSexual \nHarassment in \nWeb -Based or \nWeb -Assisted \nCourses:  \u2022 All students are required to abide by the UNC Charlotte Sexual \nHarassment Policy  and the policy on Responsible Use  of University \nComputing and Electronic Communication Resources . Sexual \nharassment, as defined in the UNC Charlotte Sexual Harassment Policy, \nis prohibited, even when carried out through computers or other \nelectronic com munications systems, including course -based chat rooms \nor message boards.  \nDiversity and \nInclusion:  \u2022 The Belk College of Business strives to create an inclusive academic \nclimate in which the dignity of all individuals is respected and \nmaintained. Therefore,  we celebrate the diversity that includes, but is not \nlimited to ability\/disability, age, culture, ethnicity, gender, language, race, \nreligion, sexual orientation, and socio -economic status  \nNon-\nDiscrimination:  \u2022 All students and the instructor are expected to engage with each other \nrespectfully. Unwelcome conduct directed toward another person based  \n \n \n \nupon that person\u2019s actual or perceived race, actual or perceived gender, \ncolor, religion, age, national origin, ethnicity, disability, or veteran status, \nor for any other reason, may constitute a violation of University Policy \n406, The Code of Student Responsibility. Any student suspected of \nengaging in such conduct will be referred to the Office of Student \nConduct.  \nDisability \nAccommodati ons: \u2022 UNC Charlotte is committed to access to education.

Textbooks   Required textbook:   Wooldridge, Jeffrey M. (2016). Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, 6th Edition. Mason, OH: South-Western Cengage Learning. (Earlier editions are okay, but I may assign problems from the 2016 edition; if so, it is your responsibility to get these.)  I find that it is very helpful to see alternative presentations of econometric methods, and therefore also list a few other texts that may be useful supplementary resources for the course and throughout your career:  Verbeek, Marno. (2012). A Guide to Modern Econometrics, 4th edition. New York, NY: John Wiley and Sons, Inc. (Earlier editions are fine.)  Angrist, J., and Pischke, J. (2009). Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion, Princeton U. Press.   Cameron, A.C., and Trivedi, P.K. (2010). Microeconometrics Using Stata, Stata Press.  Course website I will post most course related materials to the course Canvas page, including the syllabus. However, not all information covered in class will necessarily be posted (see attendance policy below). Although I will do my best to stick to the dates in Canvas for modules and assignments, naturally these are subject to change. Exam dates will not change \u2013 see exam policy below.  Course Description and Objectives This is an advanced course in econometrics, aiming to equip students with a foundation for conducting quantitative research. We will cover several estimation methods, including least squares, maximum likelihood, instrumental variables, along with econometric issues such as multicollinearity, heteroskedasticity, and autocorrelation. The main objective of the course is to provide students with the tools needed to read, evaluate, and contribute to the body of applied economic literature.  2 Software We will use STATA for this course, which is available on all Belk College computers and is accessible remotely using UNCC\u2019s Apporto (https:\/\/charlotte.apporto.com\/ ). If you wish to obtain STATA for your own computer, you can get a discounted student edition: http:\/\/www.stata.com\/order\/new\/edu\/gradplans\/student-pricing\/ (Note: STATA\/BE will be sufficient for this course.)   Attendance Attendance is strongly encouraged but will not count directly towards the course grade. Students are responsible for all information and materials presented in class. If you must miss a class, you will be responsible for getting notes and any handouts from a classmate.  Grading Course grades will be based on the number of points you earn on three in-class exams, problem sets, and the course replication project; the weights assigned to each of these are shown below. There will NOT be opportunities for extra credit.   Weights for Final Grade Calculation   Scale for Assigning Letter Grades Exam 1  25%     90% - 100% A Exam 2  25%     80% - 89% B Exam 3  25%     70% - 79% C Problem Sets  10%     Below 70% U Project   15%       Re-grading: If you would like your exam re-graded, you must submit a re-grade request in writing within 1 week from when the graded exams are passed back in class (if you miss this class, your deadline is not extended). Your request must clearly note where and why you think you deserve additional points. Note: your entire exam will be re-graded, so your final score may go up or down.  Exams If you cannot be there on exam days (listed below), do not take this class. Makeup exams are not given. Missed exams will be given a grade of zero. The only exceptions will be decided at the discretion of the instructor, and will only be considered for extreme situations such as a documented serious illness or family emergency, with advance notice and adequate written documentation. In these instances, we will discuss options for alternative grade weighting.  Exam 1 Tuesday, September 17 (in class)  Exam 2 Tuesday, October 29 (in class)  Exam 3 Tuesday, December 10 at 5:00pm  Problem Sets There will be six sets during the semester, and you will be given at least one week to work on them. Problem sets are graded on effort on a scale of 1-5. The problem sets are designed to deepen your understanding of the material and prepare you for exams; you should go through the solutions carefully after they are posted. You may work together but programming statements (including variable names) and your answers must be unique to each individual. No late problem sets will be accepted.  Proposed Course Outline (subject to change)  3 The course outline is intended to give you an idea of the material we will cover, and may change as the semester goes on. Introduction to the course (Ch. 1) Review of mathematical tools: Calculus \/ Matrix Algebra \/ Statistics (Appendices) Simple Linear Regression (Ch. 2) Multiple Linear Regression:  Estimation (Ch. 3) Inference (Ch. 4) OLS Asymptotics (Ch. 5) Further issues (Ch. 6) Binary variables (Ch. 7) Heteroscedasticity (Ch. 8) Specification and data issues (Ch. 9)  Time Series   Basic regression analysis (Ch. 10)   Further issues (Ch. 11)   Serial correlation and heteroscedasticity (Ch. 12)  Binary Response Models (Ch. 17)  Replication project You will replicate many of the main findings from a published, peer-reviewed paper. This project is intended to give you practice applying the theory from class using Stata. The project will be completed in multiple stages, and more details about what is expected for the project (and in each stage) will be given in class. You may work in groups of 2-3 students, but may NOT consult with anyone other than your group members and myself. You may use Stata resources available on the web, but may NOT use anything you may find that is directly related to replicating the paper or contact the author(s) of the paper.  Course Policies   Late Work: Late work is given a score of zero. No exceptions.   Email communication: Email is the best way to reach me outside of office hours or class time. I will try to respond to your email in a timely manner (within 24 hours), but an immediate response is not guaranteed. Please use appropriate email etiquette in any communication (e.g., include salutation, signature (name), and no abbreviations).     Life happens: If you become seriously ill, experience the death of a loved one or have a life altering experience (e.g., divorce) that is negatively influencing your participation in our class, please contact me as soon as possible so we can discuss your options. See more on student support services below.\u2028  Do your own work! While I have no problem with you working with your classmates to understand the material, please do not turn in answers that are identical (or nearly identical) to anyone else\u2019s or to other solutions you may find online. The first violation will result in a score of zero on the assignment; further violations will be handled through university channels. See more information on academic (dis)honesty below. \u2028  4  Other Important Reminders   The above is subject to change. The course information outlined in this syllabus may be modified at any time, depending on how the course progresses; any such changes will be clearly communicated by announcements in class and via email.  Academic Honesty. All students are required to read and abide by the Code of Student Academic Integrity. Violations of the Code of Student Academic Integrity, including plagiarism, will result in disciplinary action as provided in the Code. Definitions and examples of plagiarism are set forth in the Code. The Code is available from the Dean of Students Office or online at http:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/up-407.

Weights for Final Grade Calculation   Scale for Assigning Letter Grades Exam 1  25%     90% - 100% A Exam 2  25%     80% - 89% B Exam 3  25%     70% - 79% C Problem Sets  10%     Below 70% U Project   15%       Re-grading: If you would like your exam re-graded, you must submit a re-grade request in writing within 1 week from when the graded exams are passed back in class (if you miss this class, your deadline is not extended). Your request must clearly note where and why you think you deserve additional points. Note: your entire exam will be re-graded, so your final score may go up or down.  Exams If you cannot be there on exam days (listed below), do not take this class. Makeup exams are not given. Missed exams will be given a grade of zero. The only exceptions will be decided at the discretion of the instructor, and will only be considered for extreme situations such as a documented serious illness or family emergency, with advance notice and adequate written documentation. In these instances, we will discuss options for alternative grade weighting.  Exam 1 Monday, February 19 (in class)  Exam 2 Monday, April 1 (in class)  Exam 3 Monday, May 6 at 5:00pm  Problem Sets I will assign a few problem sets during the semester. You may work together but programming statements (including variable names) and your answers must be unique to each individual. You will be given at least one week to work on them. No late problem sets will be accepted.  Proposed Course Outline (subject to change) The course outline is intended to give you an idea of the material we will cover, and may change as the semester goes on.

The course material \nwill be  a selective combination of a few  excellent books in \nstatistical learning, data mining, and machine lear ning, such as  \nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning wi th Applications in \nR, by G. James, D . Witten, T . Hastie and R . Tibshirani, \nSpringer, 2013. ISBN 978 -1-4614 -7137 -0 ISBN 978 -1-4614 -7138 -7 (eBook)  \n(The university has full access to the eBook  of the textbook.)  \nCourse Description:   This course provides  students a survey of major statistical learning \nmethods and concepts for both supervised and unsup ervised \nlearning including resampling methods, support vector machines, \nmodel selection and regularization, tree -based methods and \nensembles, statistical graphics. Students learn how and when to \napply statistical learning techniques, their comparative strengths \nand weaknesses, and how to critically evaluate the performance of \nlearning algorithms  in case studies in financial investment, gene \nidentification, and feature selection in high -dimensional spaces . \nSoftware R will be used for simulations and for real data analysis.  \n \nCourse Objectives:  By providing  students a survey of major statistical learning methods, the course is \ndesigned for students to learn how and when to apply statistica l learning techniques, how \nto critically evaluate the performance of le arning algorithms, and how to build predictive \nmodels.  Students completing this course should be able to apply basic statistical learning \nmethods to build predictive models, to properly tune and select statistical learning \nmodels, to correctly assess model fit and error, and to build an ensemble of learning \nalgorithms  for data . \nInstructional Method :  \nThe primary format for instructio n will be lectures  in the classroom .   \n \nMeans of Student Evaluation :  \nAttendance (5%): Attendance is required . For each unexcused  absence,  you will  lose \n10% of the  attendance  points. If you miss 10 or more than 10 classes, you will receive a \nU for the  final grade without exception. If you miss a class, it will be  your responsibility \nto obtain the assignmen t and find out what material is  covered.  \nPop q uizzes (5%): Several pop quizzes will be given either online or at any time in  \nlecture s. All pop quizzes will be open book and open notes. No make up for missed \nquizzes if there is no legitimate  excuse.  \nHomework a ssignments (20%): Reading relevant sections in  reference  books  after \nclasses  is always expected. Homew ork will be  assigned in class or through Canvas . \nHomework will be  due at the beginning of class on the due date. No late homework will \nbe accepted.  \nCourse p roject (15%) : Students will make groups to work on a course project at the end \nof the semester.  \nMidterm e xam (25%): You will be inf ormed in advance about the date  and the mate rial \ncoverage of the midterm exam. The midterm exam may be open or closed book. If it is \nclosed book, you may choose to prepare a form ula sheet for reference for the  exam . \nFinal  exam (30 %): The final exam may be open or closed book . A formula sheet and \nsome selected tables will be pr ovided for the final exam  if appropriate. The final exam \nwill contain 20% multiple choices , true\/ false, or blank -filling questions  and 80% free \nresponse  questions . If a student misses the final exam, his\/her  final grade for the course \nwould be either an I or a U, depending on his\/her  performance on previous work.   \n \nSoftware and C omputing:  \nStudents are encouraged to bring a lapto p to each class . The course will make extensive \nuse of the free  R software environment for statistical computing and graphics. \nIntroductory tutorials\/labs will be provided for students unfamiliar with R. Students are \nencouraged to install R on their  laptop s before the semester begin s. Copies of R may be \ndownloaded from http:\/\/www.rproject.org . \n Class Policies:  \nAcademic integrity: UNC Charlotte is committed to the highest standards of academic integrity \nand honesty. Students are expected to be familiar with these standards regarding academic \nhonesty and to uphold the policies of the University  in this respect. Students are particularly urged \nto familiarize themselves with the provisions of the Code of Student Behavior. Violation of these \nsyllabus policies may result in appropriate academic penalties, including reduction of grade in the \nrelevant assignment, project, test, or exam. If violation of these syllabus policies also implicates the \nCode of Student Academic Integrity because of alleged  academic misconduct , I will follow \nthe process outlined in the Code  to address such cases.  \nClass Absence(s) : The instructor has the authority to excuse a student\u2019s class absence(s) and to \ngrant a student academic  accommodation (turn in a late assignment, provide extra time on an \nassignment, reschedule an exam, etc.). Students are encouraged to work directly with their \ninstructors regarding class absences for  medical appointments, military\/court orders, and\/or \npersonal and family emergencies.  For absences due to  religious observances , students must \nprovide the instructor  with written notice of requested accommodations  no later than the 10th day \nof instruction for the semester.  \nGrading policy:  Course letter grades will follow the scale listed below (not curved):  \n 90-100%  A  \n 80-89% B  \n70-79% C  \n             0-69%  U \nMake -up policy:  No make -up exam will be given without prior notification and documented \nacceptable excuse. If you miss an exam due to a legitimate excuse, you need to call or email me \neither before the exam or within 24 hours after the exam, and I will try to find an alternative to the \nassessment on the student\u2019s mastery of the material. The make -up test is an essay exam with the \nsame contents as the test.  \nCheating : Cheating in any form will result in a \u201cU\u201d for the course grade and may be reported to the \nUniversity.  \nExpected conduct in class : Coming to class late or leaving class early is NOT allowed. Any \ndistracting behavior such as TALKING or LAUGHING or YELLING in class is prohibited. Electronic \ndevices other than a laptop also cause distraction during classes and are thus not permitted either. \nMore classroom policies can be found at http:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/legal -topics\/classroom -policies -and-\npractices  \nAccommodation requests: UNC Charlotte is committed to access to education. If you have a \ndisability and need academic accommodation , please send me your accommodation letter as early \nas possible. You are encouraged to meet with me to discuss the accommodation  outlined in your \nletter. For more information on accommodation , contact the Office of Disability Services at 704 -\n687-0040 or Fretwell 230.  \nGrief absence policy for students: UNC Charlotte recognizes that a time of bereavement is very \ndifficult for a student. The University therefore provides the following rights to students facing the \nloss of a family member through the Grief Absence Policy for Students (GAPS): Students will be \nexcused for funeral leave and given the opportunity to earn equivalent credit and to demonstrate evidence of meeting the learning outcomes for missed assignments or assessments in the event of \nthe death of a member of the student\u2019s family.  \nStatement on Diversity : UNC Charlotte strives to create an inclusive academic climate in which \nthe dignity of all individuals is respected and maintained. Therefore, we create diversity that \nincludes, but is not limited to ability\/disability, age, culture, ethnicity, gender, language, race, \nreligion, sexual orientation, and socio -economic status.  \n \nCivil Rights and Title IX :  Remember that all UNC Charlotte employees, including faculty \nmembers, are expected to report any incidents of (a) sexual or interpersonal misconduct or related \nretaliation or (b) discrimination, discriminatory harassment, or related retaliation they receive to \nOffice of Civil Rights and Title IX. The preferred method of such reporting is to use the online \nincident report form. You are encouraged to consult with Office of Civil Rights and Title IX at \n704.687.6130 with any questions related to discrimination or sexual or interpersonal misconduct. \nFor more information, visit civilrights.charlotte.edu  and https:\/\/legal.charlotte.edu\/legal -topics\/civil -\nrights -and-title-ix.  \nBasic needs services : UNC Charlotte defines basic needs as those needs that, when unmet, can \nhinder students\u2019 ability to focus on and successfully complete their academic studies. Basic needs \ninclude food security, housing security, transportation, health and wellbeing, technology and \nchildcare . Any student who has trouble  in one or more of these areas is urged to contact the \nStudent Assistance and Support Services (SASS) Office for support with navigating campus and \ncommunity resources. Students can also consult the Niner Needs website for a list of helpful \nresources designed to address student needs ( https:\/\/ninerneeds.charlotte.edu\/ ). \n \n  \n Recommended:  There are many u niversity resources to support students (UCAE, WRC, Atkins Library,  \nCGL, etc.) . You are recommended to utilize theses resources for learning.  \n \nAttachments:   N\/A \n \nOthers: The standards and requirements set forth in this syllabus may be modified at any time by the \ncourse instructor.

This is an important  course  in developing  decision  models  and their application s \nto management problems. The emphasis is on models that are widely used in all industries and  \n \n \n 2 functional areas, including operations, supply chain management, finance, accounting, and  \nmarketing.  \nSpecific topics covered in this course include  fundamental  techniques  such as linear,  integer,  \ngoal and multi  objective  programming,  nonlinear programming, and forecasting . In this course, \nstudents learn to model  the business problems, analyze and solve  the models, and then interpret  \nthe solutions obtained to make recommendations  to managers. The emphasis will be on both \nformulating an appropriate model for a given  business problem and developing an Excel based \nsolution approach by utilizing built -in and  add-in software  tools.   \n \nPrerequisites:  MBAD  5141  or equivalent.  A keen  interest  in problem  solving  (logic,  math,  and \nstatistics) and a desire to practice higher level analytics and applied information technology  \nskills.  \n \nCatalog  Description:  An analytical  approach  to the management  process.  Generalized  models  \nfor decision  making  with major  emphasis  on application  of the scientific  method  to \nmanagement  problems.  \n \nLEARNING  OBJECTIVES  \nUpon completion of the course the students should be able to  \n\u2022 Demonstrate proficiency in using advanced Excel, including the build -in Solver  \n\u2022 Formulate and solve optimization problems arising in operations and supply chain \nmanagement contexts.  \n\u2022  Interpret and assess the results produced by the optimization models and Excel solver  \n\u2022 Run sensitivity and what -if analysis, understand their implications and make \nrecommendations  \n\u2022 Apply the modeling approach to various business applications to make sound managerial \ndecisions based on data   \n \nCOURSE  MATERIALS  \nTextbook:   \n\u2022 Spreadsheet  Modeling  and Decision  Analysis:  A Practical  Introduction  to Business  Analytics , \n9th edition,  by Cliff  T. Ragsdale,  Cengage  Learning,  2021. ISBN:  978-0-357-13209 -8. ( 8th \nEd. will also work ).  \n\u2022 CENGAGE UNLIMITED eTEXTBOOKS ($69.99\/semester ) gives students access to \nunlimited number of eBooks.  https:\/\/www.cengage.com\/unlimited\/  \n \nCourse Website:  http:\/\/canvas.uncc.edu  \n\u2022 Use of Canvas:  Canvas  will be the website  for course  information  and primary  \ncommunication  channel  for this class.  You may access  UNCC  Canvas  from  My UNC  \nCharlotte  (https:\/\/my.uncc.edu\/ ) or direct type canvas.uncc.edu\/ . It\u2019s each student\u2019s \nresponsibility to  check  Canvas  regularly  and report  anything  that does not match  your own \nrecord  (e.g.,  missing  or wrong  grade) within  SEVEN  calendar  days since  the date the \ninformation was  posted.   \n \n 3 \u2022 Grades: Grades on exams  and assignments  will be posted on Canvas .  Please check that the \ngrade posted matches  the grade on your paper  copy and notif y the instructor  as soon as possible  \nin case of a discrepancy.   \n \nWithdrawal from Class:  \nThe administration of this institution has set deadlines for withdrawal of any college -level  \ncourses. These dates and times are published in that semester's course catalog. Administration  \nprocedures  must  be followed.  It is the student's  responsibility  to handle  withdrawal  requirements  \nfrom  any class.  In other  words,  I cannot  drop or withdraw  any student.  You must  do the proper \npaperwork to ensure that you will not receive a final grade of \"U\" in a course if  you choose not \nto attend the class once you are enrolled.  \n \nIncomplete Grade Policy:  \nReceiving a grade of incomplete (\u201cI\u201d) is not based solely on a student\u2019s failure to complete  work  \nor as a means  of raising  his\/her  grade  by doing  additional  work  after the grade  report  time.  As per \nuniversity policy , incomplete grades will be granted when a student who is otherwise  passing has \nnot, due to circumstances beyond his\/her control, completed all the work in the  course. The \nmissing work must be completed and the final grade reported within one calendar  year from  the \ndate on  which  the \u201cI\u201d grade  was recorded.  The instructor  assigning  the \u201cI\u201d grade  may specify a \nshorter time than one year for completion of the work and the assignment of a  final grade. If the \n\u201cI\u201d is not removed during the specified time, a grade of \u201cF\u201d, \u201cU\u201d, or \u201cN\u201d, as  appropriate  is \nautomatically  assigned.  Time  extensions  for the completion  of an \u201cI\u201d beyond  one year cannot be \napproved except by special request to the Graduate School under extraordinary  circumstances. \nThe grade of \u201cI\u201d cannot be removed by enrolling again in the same course, and  students  should \nnot re-enroll in  a course  in which  they have  been assigned the  grade  of \u201cI\u201d. \n \nCOURSE  ASSESSMENT  \n \nThe course grades will be based on two group projects , class participation , and two exams with a \ntotal of 250 points.  \n \nAssignment s Format  Points  \nMidterm Exam  Individual  100 points  \nFinal Exam  Individual  100 points  \nParticipation  Individual    10 points  \nCase report s Group    40 points  \nTotal                                   250 points  \n \nExams  \nThe t wo exams, Midterm Exam  (October  21st) and Final Exam ( December 9th) are NOT \ncumulative . There will be no makeup exams . Conflicts for the exams must be resolved before \nthe exam dates. You should contact me at least one weeks prior to the exam date.   Last minute \nrequests will not be accept ed. The only reasons for not being able to sit for an examination in \nits announced time should be part of University policy, or a documented medical excuse . \nMissing an exam without prior approval and\/or providing supporting documentation within the  \n \n 4 following timeframe will lead to a grade of zero for that exam. In the event that the excuse is \napproved before the exam date (in rare case and requires supporting documentation), the \nstudent will be given a make -up exam. A student who misses an exam without prior approval, \npossibly due to unexpected situation on the exam day, should contact the instructor within 12 \nhours of the exam start date\/time and provide appropriate supporting documentation to be \neligible for a makeup exam. It is the student\u2019s respon sibility to be aware of and follow the make -\nup exam policies and no special accommodations will be made for any exceptions. No makeup \nexam will be given after the last day of class.  \n \n\u201cRe-grade\u201d Requests  \nAny request to re -grade any component of your submissions (assignment or exam or project) has \nto be made within seven (7) days  after the grade has been posted  on the Canvas . Given the speed \nwith which the course progresses, any request beyond this deadline cannot be considered. The only \nexception to this rule is a documented emergency. Write a brief note explaining why you think \nthere is an error in grading. Attach a copy of the graded assignment.  The instructor reserves the \nright to re -grade the entire contents of any submitted assignment.

This  is an important  course  in developing  decision  models  \nand their  application s to management problems. The emphasis is on models that are \nwidely used in all industries and  functional areas, including operations, supply chain \nmanagement, finance, accounting, and  marketing.  \nSpecific topics covered in this course include  fundamental  techniques  such  as linear,  \ninteger,  goal  and multi  objective  programming,  queuing  theory and applications, decision \nsupport via Monte Carlo simulation, decision making under  uncertainty  and risk, decision \ntrees,  and multi -criteria  decision making.  \n \nIn this course, students learn to model  the business problems, analyze and solve  the \nmodels, and then interpret  the solutions obtained to make recommendations  to managers.  \nThe emphasis will be on both formulating an appropriate model for a given  business \nproblem and developing an Excel based solution approach by utilizing built -in and  add-in \nsoftware  tools like  Analytic Solver Platform  and Data Analysis.   \n \nPrerequisites:  MBAD  5141  or equivalent.  A keen  interest  in problem  solving  (logic,  math,  \nand statistics) and a desire to practice higher level analytics and applied information \ntechnology  skills.  \n \n \n \n 2 Catalog  Description:  An analytical  approach  to the management  process.  Generalized  \nmodels  for decision  making  with  major  emphasis  on application  of the scientific  method  \nto management  problems.  \n \nLEARNING  OBJECTIVES  \nUpon completion of the course the students should be able to  \n\u2022 Demonstrate proficiency in using advanced Excel, including the build -in Solver  \n\u2022 Formulate and solve optimization problems arising in operations and supply chain \nmanagement contexts.  \n\u2022  Interpret a nd assess the results produced by the optimization models and Excel solver  \n\u2022 Run sensitivity and what -if analysis, understand their implications and make recommendations  \n\u2022 Apply the modeling approach to various business applications to make sound managerial \ndecisions based on data   \n\u2022 Run Monte Carlo simulation  using Analytic Solver Platform  \n \nStudent Support:   The details of student support resources available are provided at the \nfollowing links.  \nAcademic support: https:\/\/ninernationcares.uncc.edu\/students\/academic -support . \nHealth support:  https:\/\/ninernationcares.uncc.e du\/health -support -services  \n       IT support:  https:\/\/help.uncc.edu\/  \n \nLaptop  requirement:  All upper -level  (including  graduate  level)  business  students  are \nrequired  to have  their  own  personal  laptop  computer.

Ragsdale,  Cengage  Learning,  2017. ISBN:  978 -\n1305947412.  (7th Ed. will also work ).  \n\u2022 CENGAGE UNLIMITED eTEXTBOOKS ($69.99\/semester ) gives students access to \nunlimited number of eBooks.  https:\/\/www.cengage.com\/unlimited\/  \n \nCourse Website:  http:\/\/canvas.uncc.edu  \n\u2022 Use  of Canvas:  Canvas  will be the website  for course  information  and primary  \ncommunication  channel  for this class.  You  may  access  UNCC  Canvas  from  My UNC  \nCharlotte  (https:\/\/my.uncc.edu\/ ) or direct type canvas.uncc.edu\/ . It\u2019s each student\u2019s \nresponsibility to  check  Canvas  regularly  and report  anything  that  does  not match  your  \nown  record  (e.g.,  missing  or wrong  grade) within  SEVEN  calendar  days since  the date  \nthe information was  posted.  \n\u2022 Grades: Grades on exams  and assignments  will be posted on Canvas .  Please check that \nthe grade posted matches  the grade on your paper  copy and notif y the instructor  as soon \nas possible  in case of a discrepancy.   \n \nWithdrawal from Class:  \nThe administration of this institution has set deadlines for withdrawal of any college -level  \ncourses. These dates and times are published in that semester's course catalog. \nAdministration  procedures  must  be followed.  It is the student's  responsibility  to handle  \nwithdrawal  requirements  from  any class.  In other  words,  I cannot  drop  or withdraw  any \nstudent.  You  must  do the proper paperwork to ensure that you will not receive a final grade \nof \"U\" in a course if  you choose not to attend the class once you are enrolled. The last day \nto withdraw from a  course  (grade  subject to  Withdrawal Policy)  is March 20  202 2. \n \nIncomplete Grade Policy:  \nReceiving a grade of incomplete (\u201cI\u201d) is not based solely on a student\u2019s failure to complete  \nwork  or as a means  of raising  his\/her  grade  by doing  additional  work  after  the grade  report  \ntime.  As per university policy , incomplete grades will be granted when a student who is \notherwise  passing has not, due to circumstances beyond his\/her control, completed all the \nwork in the  course. The missing work must be completed and the final grade reported \nwithin one calendar  year  from  the date on  which  the \u201cI\u201d grade  was  recorded.  The instructor  \nassigning  the \u201cI\u201d grade  may specify a shorter time than one year for completion of the work \nand the assignment of a  final grade. If the \u201cI\u201d is not removed d uring the specified time, a \ngrade of \u201cF\u201d, \u201cU\u201d, or \u201cN\u201d, as  appropriate  is automatically  assigned.  Time  extensions  for the \ncompletion  of an \u201cI\u201d beyond  one year cannot be approved except by special request to the \nGraduate School under extraordinary  circumstances. The grade of \u201cI\u201d cannot be removed by  \n \n 4 enrolling again in the same course, and  students  should not  re-enroll in  a course  in which  \nthey have  been assigned the  grade  of \u201cI\u201d. \n \nCOURSE  ASSESSMENT  \n \nThe course grades will be based on t wo exams , class participation  and a final group project \nwith a total of 235 points.  \n \nAssignment s Format  Points  \nExam  1 Individual  100 points  \nExam 2  Individual  100 points  \nParticipation  Individual    10 points  \nGroup Project  Group    25 points  \nTotal                                       235 points  \n \n \nExams  \nThe t wo exams, Exam  1 (March 13th) and Final E xam ( May 8th), are NOT cumulative . \nThere will be no makeup exams . Conflicts for the exams must be resolved before the exam \ndates. You should contact me at least one weeks prior to the exam date.   Last minute \nrequests will not be accept ed. The only reasons for not being able to sit for an \nexamination in its announced tim e should be part of University policy, or a \ndocumented medical excuse . Missing an exam without prior approval and\/or providing \nsupporting documentation within the following timeframe will lead to a grade of zero for \nthat exam. In the event that the excuse is approved before the exam date (in rare case \nand requires supporting documentation), the student will be given a make -up exam. A \nstudent who misses an exam without prior approval, possibly due to unexpected situation \non the exam day, should contact the instructor within 12 hours of the exam start date\/time \nand provide appro priate supporting documentation to be eligible for a makeup exam. It is \nthe student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of and follow the make -up exam policies and no \nspecial accommodations will be made for any exceptions. No makeup exam will be given \nafter the l ast day of class.  \n \n\u201cRe-grade\u201d Requests  \nAny request to re -grade any component of your submissions (assignment or exam or \nproject) has to be made within seven (7) days  after the grade has been posted  on the Canvas . \nGiven the speed with which the course progresses, any request beyond this deadline cannot \nbe considered. The only exception to this rule is a documented emergency. Write a brief note \nexplaining why you think there is an error in grading. Attach a copy of the graded assignment.  \nThe instructor r eserves the right to re -grade the entire contents of any submitted \nassignment. Your grade may go up or down.   \n \n 5 Class  attendance and participation  \nEach student is expected  to attend every  class.  Participation grades  will be based on the \nquality and impact o f your class participation . Voluntary class participation will consist of \nvoluntary contributions and occasional cold calls, usually to answer questions.  \n  \nTo evaluate  your  contribution  to the class  discussions,  the following  criteria  are to be applied:  \n\u2022 Is the comment accurate, reflecting case facts?  \n\u2022 Does the comment add to our understanding of the problem situation?  \n\u2022 Is the comment timely and linked to the comments of others?  \n\u2022 Does the comment move the discussion along by giving a new perspective?  \n\u2022 Does the  comment reflect a concern for maintaining a constructive and comfortable \nclassroom atmosphere?  \n\u2022 Is the comment clear and concise?  \n \nAs with any medical absence, it is a student\u2019s responsibility to contact you if they are unable to \nattend class because they are ill.

You will collaborate with other \nstudents  in this course  as part of a group.  The project  will be assigned  at the mid- \npoint of the semester and each group will have the chance to choose between \nseveral projects provided by the professor.  A group can pitch an idea for an \noriginal database project as well.  \nThe project will require proper design, development and implementation of a \nrelational or NoSQL database  that addresses  an opportunity.  Front -end and back -\nend components  will be in place to provide common functions (create, read, \nupdate, delete) and data queries for browsing, searching and filtering.  The project \nis not trivial but not so complex that it requires more than the time allotted.  \nResources required to host your project will typically be a MySQL database or \nMongoDB Database (NoSQL) and web or application interface. Your project can be \nhosted locally but web or cloud is recommended.  \n \nThe project has several milestones in the form of project deliverables in order to \nkeep  your  work  progressing.  Project  deliverables  must  be met;  no late work  will be \naccepted.  Students have the chance to correct deficiencies on their deliverables in \nall but the final project deliverable.  \n \nProjects will be supported by SQL  and\/or NoSQL  code and a presentation \ndemonstrating the project.  Students  can learn  from  each other  and this is a great \nopportunity  to share ideas and techniques!  Course  Syllabus  Page  14  All project  details  will be provided  in the formal  project  assignment  made  no later \nthan the 11th week of class.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCourse Format and  Activities  \nThis course will draw materials primarily from the textbook and \nhandouts\/materials posted on the course website.  Students will study the \nmaterials and complete all the course requirements. In order to properly address \nthe assignments  for this class,  you will need  to put in a considerable  amount  of time \nand energy.  Please log on often to check for announcements, assignments, course \ndocuments, news forums, grades daily to stay informed.  \n \nReading:  \nThe readings  for this course  will be taken  from  the textbook  and a variety  of other \ncurrent sources.  Students must read the course materials and post any questions \nthat you wish to be discussed on the forum.  \n \nGroup  discussion:  \nThe most  vital  use of Discussion  Forums  is to exchange  ideas  with  other  classmates. \nIt is important  that you check  into the forums  regularly.  You are  encouraged  to ask \nquestions regarding the required readings, discuss the unit topics, share \ninformation and resources with classmates, and respond to problems posted by \nyour classmates or instructor.  You should read everyone\u2019s posts and responses to \nthe topics that interest you.  \n \nSubmission  of Work:  \n\u2022 Follow  each  assignment  instruction;  all work  should  be uploaded  into the \nassignment link as requested. Datacamp Assignments are graded in  \nDatacamp.  It is the students\u2019  responsibility  to keep his\/her  copies  of all \nwork  submitted  to the instructor.  All work  is to be turned  in by the due \ndate, no late work will be accepted.  \n \nPolicy  on Academic  Integrity:  The university  policy  407, the Code  of Student \nAcademic Integrity, applies. This policy is available at \nhttp:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/up -407. Course  Syllabus  Page  15  Academic honesty is absolutely essential.

You will collaborate with other students in this course \nas part of a group. The project will be assigned at the mid -point of the seme ster and each \ngroup will have the chance to choose between several projects provided  by the professor.  A \ngroup can pitch an idea for an original database project as well.    \nThe project will use MIMIC -IV database, which require proper design, development and \nimplementation of a database. Resources required to host your project will typically be a \nMySQL database and you will extract information for data analysis or building predictive \nmodel .  \nThe project has several milestones in the form of project deliverables in order to keep your \nwork progressing.  Project deliverables must be met; no late work will be accepted.  \nStudents have the chance to correct deficiencies on their deliverables in all but the final \nproject deliverable.  Participation is required. Peer reviews will be collected and made \npart of the project grade.  \nCourse Format and Activities  \nThis course is designed based on  the curriculum developed by Dr. Pam Thompson.

You will collaborate  with four or five \nother  students  in this course.  The project  will be assigned  at the mid-point  of the semester.  \nThe project  will focus  on relational  databases  or data warehouses.  \nThe project  will require  proper  design,  development  and implementation  of a database  \nthat addresses  an opportunity.  Front -end and back -end components  will be in place  to \nprovide common  functions  (create,  read, update,  delete)  and data queries  for browsing,  \nsearching and filtering.  The project  is not trivial  but not so complex  that it requires  more  \nthan the time allotted.  Resources  required  to host your project  will typically  be a MySQL  \ndatabase  and web or application  interface.  Your  project  can be hosted  locally  but web or \ncloud  is recommended.  \nThe project  has several  milestones  in the form of project  deliverables  in order  to keep \nyour work  progressing.  Project  deliverables  must be met; no late work  will be \naccepted. Students  have the chance  to correct  deficiencies  on their deliverables  in \nall but the final project  deliverable.  \nProjects  will be supported  by a project  repository  such as Github  and a video  (no longer  \nthan 6 minutes)  or narrated  PPT demonstrating  the project.  Students  can learn from each \nother and this is a great  opportuity  to share  ideas  and techniques!  \nAll project  details  will be provided  in the formal  project  assignment  made  around  \nthe midpoint  of the semester.  \nCourse  Format  and Activities  \nThis course  will draw materials  primarily  from the textbook  and \nhandouts\/materials  posted  on the course  website.

opportunity to explore and experience \ndatabase design and programming in practice. You will collaborate with other \nstudents  in this course  as part of a group.  The project  will be assigned  at the mid- \npoint of the semester and each group will have the chance to choose between \nseveral projects provided by the professor.  A group can pitch an idea for an \noriginal database project as well.  \nThe project will require proper design, development and implementation of a \nrelational or NoSQL database  that addresses  an opportunity.  Front -end and back -\nend components  will be in place to provide common functions (create, read, \nupdate, delete) and data queries for browsing, searching and filtering.  The project \nis not trivial but not so complex that it requires more than the time allotted.  \nResources required to host your project will typically be a MySQL database or \nMongoDB Database (NoSQL) and web or application interface. Your project can be \nhosted locally but web or cloud is strongly recommended.  \n \nThe project has several milestones in the form of project deliverables in order to \nkeep  your  work  progressing.  Project  deliverables  must  be met;  no late work  will be \naccepted.  Students have the chance to correct deficiencies on their deliverables in \nall but the final project deliverable.  \n \nProjects will be supported by SQL  and\/or NoSQL  code and a presentation \ndemonstrating the project.  Students  can learn  from  each other  and this is a great \nopportunity  to share ideas and techniques!

It is an essential part of AI, which is one of the hottest topics in computer science today. Data mining is a fast-evolving field, especially for recent five years.  The availability of large amounts of data has created unprecedented opportunities to leverage computational and statistical approaches to turn data into actionable knowledge. This course covers general techniques for analyzing large amounts of numerical and text data. The entire data mining process is covered in this course: setting up a problem, data preprocessing, model constructions, model evaluations, and interpretations in decision making.   This course covers both classical data mining approach (e.g., Apriori, Random Forest, etc) as well as the recent deep learning models (e.g., RNN, CNN, BERT). In addition, the recent rise of large language models (LLMs), especially ChatGPT, has brought global excitement. We will have LLMs as one of our topics.     Required Textbooks and Papers:   We will use textbooks, online learning materials, and academic papers as our learning materials. For all the papers, Dr. Niu will provide the full-text versions. For textbooks, Dr. Niu will provide the electronic copies.

Efforts may include but is not limited to: required reading, homework assignments, and studying for quizzes.  Class Attendance Policy: Attending every class is mandatory. Class attendance entails being prepared, present, and attentive for the entire class period. One or two absences (excused or unexcused) is OK without losing the class attendance points (5 points), but you will lose the in-class quiz points for those absence(s). Three or four absences will lose all your class attendance points (5 points). Five or more absences in total will result in U in the course. For each absence, the student is responsible for catching up with all covered materials and assignments.  Late Submissions:  For assignments, unexcused late submission (according to the Canvas timestamp and the \u201clate\u201d flag) will receive a grade of 0. You should plan sufficiently for completing and submitting assignments. Should an emergency arise that greatly disrupts one\u2019s ability to complete an assignment, please send an email to Dr. Niu before the due date with a plan for submission after the due date. You need to receive Dr. Niu\u2019s permission for late submission.    Special Needs and Religious Accommodation: If you have a documented disability and require accommodation in this course, contact the Office of Disability Services (https:\/\/ds.uncc.edu\/students\/academic) the first week of the semester. Accommodations for learning will be arranged by that office and communicated to Dr. Niu.  It is the obligation of students to provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of religious observances on which they will be absent by submitting a Request for Religious Accommodation Form to their instructor prior to the census date for enrollment for a given semester. The census date for each semester (typically the tenth day of instruction) can be found in UNC Charlotte\u2019s Academic Calendar (https:\/\/registrar.uncc.edu\/printable-calendar).

Late credit equals\na 20% reduction per day to the grade you would have received. For example, if you would have received\na grade of 90% for comple ting a\nparticular assignment, you will receive a grade of 70%, if it was one day late.\nExtensions :\nShould you desire an extension for some reason, you must discuss it with me before  the assignment is\ndue. \nTechnology:\nNearly all students have access to some sort of electronic device. Many activities require the usage of a\nweb browser (Chrome), Document (Google Docs, MS W ord) or Presentation software. If students have a\nconcern about this requirement, they should contact the professor at the beginning of the term to discuss\naccommodations.\nDiscussion Forum:\nTo ensure that all questions and answers are shared with all students, course-related questions should\nbe posted to the forum: General Questions and Answers\n(https:\/\/uncc.instructure.com\/courses\/223325\/discussion_topics\/1937802) . Students should only email the\ninstructor if they have a personal issue they need to discuss. If students do email the professor with a\nnon-personal question, the professor reserves the right to post and answer the question using the\nGeneral Forum. All students should SUBSCRIBE to the General Forum, and consider most posted\nmessages to be equivalent to making clarifications in class.\nWhy? An individual email to the instructional team is not very ef ficient for communication about typical\ncourse questions. There are also several advantages:\nCrowdsourcing - pick your classmates\u2019  brains. Students in the course have a wide variety\nof backgrounds and experience. With many students and few personnel, another student\nmay be able to provide a useful response more quickly than the instructional team.\nSynchronicity \u2013 hey , that\u2019 s MY  question. If you have a question, it is likely that someone\nelse does too, even if they have not asked it yet.\nVanguard \u2013 I hadn\u2019t thought of that.

This amounts to giving your own\nwork\/solution to another student and is a violation of academic integrity , which will be strictly upheld.\nWhile some detail may be needed, it is usually possible to find a more general way to ask such\nquestions. If additional detail is needed on the specifics of your work, course personnel may request it as\npart of their response.\nDiscussion Forum Postings Must Be Course-Related\nPlease limit the content of course discussion forum postings to course content. Only if a discussion\nforum is clearly and specifically designated to include of f-topic content should the forum be used to\ndiscuss matters that are not course-related.\nDiscussion Forum Postings Must Be Respectful Of Course Personnel and Students\nAll students are required to abide by the UNC Charlotte Code of Student Responsibility . This includes\nparticipation in the discussion forums for the course. This course will be conducted in an atmosphere of\nmutual respect . We encourage, and require your active participation in class discussions. Each of us\nmay have strongly dif fering opinions on the various topics of class discussions. The conflict of ideas is\nencouraged and welcome. The orderly questioning of the ideas of others, including those of course\npersonnel, is similarly welcome. However , we will exercise our responsibility to manage the discussions,\nso that ideas and arguments can proceed in an orderly and respectful fashion. You should expect that if\nyour conduct during class discussions seriously disrupts the atmosphere of mutual respect expected in\nthis course, you will not be permitted to participate further .\nUNC Charlotte Email\nWhen email communication about course matters is appropriate, you must use your UNC Charlotte\nemail account. Per University policy , you must have and use your of ficial University email account. It is to\nthis account that all course email communications will be directed. We recognize that many students\nprefer to use alternate email accounts. But due to privacy concerns and FERP A restrictions, course\npersonnel will NOT  send email to any account other than your of ficial University address. You may\nforward to a personal account if you like, but you are still responsible for communications that course\npersonnel send to your University account, even if the forward fails.\nAssignment Responses\/Feedback:\nThe submissions will be the basis for formative feedback that will be given as soon as possible. If you\nreview your weekly submission feedback and follow the recommendations for the report submissions,\nyou will do well in this course.\nProject Teams Exposition\nStudents may find themselves working alone or a group for certain projects or activities. This is okay as\ngroups are not in competition between each other . The rubric based grading prevents that and8\/20\/24, 2:33 PM Syllabus for 202480-Fall 2024-DSBA-6165-U90-AI & Deep Learning\nhttps:\/\/uncc.instructure.com\/courses\/223325\/assignments\/syllabus 4\/10establishes the baseline.\nProject T eams are NOT there to divide the workload.  The goal of a pair or group should be to\ndiversify ideas and strengths, as well as avoid bias and the local maxima. The instructor will never\nchange or adjust an individual students grade based the grading for individual sections of a project\nreport. When students assign another student to write any section of their project report, they are\naccepting whatever grade is assigned to that section.  All group members should look over the work\nof their teammates.\nProject Group Removal: Project Groups can split or agree to remove a member of their group at any\ntime. The group must have a really good  reason for splitting or dismissing a student and provide proper\ndocumentation. Discrimination or preferences are not good reasons for removing a group-member (see\nNon-Discrimination Policy below). A problem student is not formally removed until the professor\nresponds to the request. A dismissed students can either work by themselves or find another student\nwho was dismissed from their group to work with (if there are any). Pairs that split, or students that\nwanted to work alone can only be re-assigned at the discretion of the professor (this is to prevent friends\nfrom ditching their assigned group and working together). If a teams splits or removes a teammate on\nthe day an assignment is due, students should email the professor their completed assignment before\nthe deadline to ensure the grade is not assigned to the entire group.\nAcademic Integrity (Plagiarism) \nAll students are required to read and abide by the Code of Student Academic Integrity . Violations of the\nCode of Student Academic Integrity , including plagiarism, will result in disciplinary action as provided in\nthe Code. Definitions and examples of plagiarism are set forth in the Code. The Code is available from\nthe Dean of Students Of fice or online  (http:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/up-407) .\nFaculty may ask students to produce identification at examinations and may require students to\ndemonstrate that graded assignments completed outside of class are their own work. While some work\nmaybe done in groups, students should pay close attention to any assignments\/exams\/work that need to\nbe submitted as individual work. Plagiarism extends to groups who submit work written as a group as\nindividual work. Ask for clarity , do not make assumptions. A helpful self-check resource is this online\nPlagiarism Quiz.  (https:\/\/www.turnitin.com\/static\/plagiarism-quiz\/)\nDisability Accommodations\nThe Of fice of Disability Services works with current undergraduate and graduate students along with\nprospective students to ensure equal access to UNC Charlotte's campus and educational programs.\nAll services are dependent upon verification of eligibility . Once approved for services, students receive\naccommodations which are based upon the nature of an individual's disability and documented needs.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to register or check-in for their accommodations with a Disability\nServices counselor as soon as they have registered for classes.  Accommodations are not retroactive\nand will not begin until the student notifies his or her faculty by providing the Letter of Accommodation.8\/20\/24, 2:33 PM Syllabus for 202480-Fall 2024-DSBA-6165-U90-AI & Deep Learning\nhttps:\/\/uncc.instructure.com\/courses\/223325\/assignments\/syllabus 5\/10Please visit the Of fice of Disability Services. for additional resources, email questions to\ndisability@uncc.edu, or call 704-687-0040 for more information.

This \ncourse covers general techniques for analyzing large amounts of text data as well as bas ic \ntechniques for information retrieval.  \n \nThe current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to \nenable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but text mining (TM) \ntechniques with a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches have been develo ped \nover the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and \nmanage text data in any natural language, and about any topic. This course intends to \nprovide a systematic introduction to many of these approaches, such as word association \nmining, topic modeling, and text classification. On the other hand, information retrieval \n(IR) is a relatively mature and well -established field. We will introduce the contemporary \nretrieval models as well as their evaluations.  \n \nWe will offer Python code examples which contain implementations of many techniques \ndiscussed in this course. Homework exercises are designed based on Python to help \nstudents acquire practical skills of experimenting with the learned techniques and \napplyin g them to solve real -world application problems.  \n \nThe required background knowledge to take this course is minimal since the it is intended \nto be mostly self -contained. However, students are expected to have basic knowledge \nabout computer science, particularly some programming language, and be comfortable  \nwith some basic concepts in probability and statistics such as conditional probability and \nparameter estimation.  \n \nFaculty Information :   \nFaculty: Dr. Depeng Xu  \nEmail:  dxu7@charlotte.edu  \nOffice:  Woodward Hall 333D   \nClass Hours:  Thursdays 5:30 pm - 8:15 pm   The Dubois Center (Uptown) 1105  \nOffice Hours:   \nThursdays   4:00 pm - 5:00 pm  The Dubois Center (Uptown) 713  \nIn-Person at WWH 333D or Zoom with an appointment outside of office hours  \nZoom link:  https:\/\/charlotte -edu.zoom.us\/s\/8285295595  \n   \n \n Teaching Assistant :   \nYaxin Zhao  \nEmail:  yzhao21@charlotte.edu   \nTA Office Hours:   \nThursdays   4:00 pm - 5:00 pm  on Zoom  \nhttps:\/\/charlotte -\nedu.zoom.us\/j\/96920845966?pwd=ETAQfpcCDvB6zbbWcO1dBDZ8Pa4cM5.1  \n \n \n \nTextbooks  \n \nTitle:       Text Data Management and Analytics: A Practical Introduction to \nInformation Retrieval and Text Mining  \nAuthor(s):     ChengXiang Zhai and Sean Massung  \nPublisher:     ACM and Morgan & Claypool Publishers  \nYear:    2016  \n \n \n \n \nTitle:       Introduction to Information Retrieval  \nAuthor(s):     Christopher D.

Class attendance entails being prepared, present, and \nattentive for the entire class period. Missing class reduces your grade through the \nfollowing method: Two absences could be excused if you send an email with your \nexplanation BEFORE the beginning of the class. More than two absences (three or above) \nin total will result in U in the course. For each absence, the student is responsible for \ncatching up with all covered materials and assignments.  \n \n \n Late Submissions:  \nFor assignments, unexcused late submission (according to the Canvas timestamp and the \n\u201clate\u201d flag) will receive a grade of 0.  You should plan sufficiently for completing and \nsubmitting assignments. Should an emergency arise that greatly disrupts one\u2019s ability to \ncomplete an assignment, please send an email to Dr. Xu before the due date with a plan \nfor submission after the due date. You need to receive Dr. Xu\u2019s permission for late \nsubmission.  \n \nSpecial Needs and Religious Accommodation:  \nIf you have a documented disability and require accommodation in this course, contact \nthe Office of Disability Services (https:\/\/ds.uncc.edu\/students\/academic) the first week \nof the semester. Accommodations for learning will be arranged by that office and \ncommunicated to the Instructor.  \nIt is the obligation of students to provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of  \nreligious observances on which they will be absent by submitting a Request for  \nReligious Accommodation Form to their instructor prior to the census date for enrollment \nfor a given semester.

This course covers general techniques for analyzing large amounts of text data as well as basic techniques for information retrieval.   The current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to enable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but text mining (TM) techniques with a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches have been developed over the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and manage text data in any natural language, and about any topic. This course intends to provide a systematic introduction to many of these approaches, such as word association mining, topic modeling, and text classification. On the other hand, information retrieval (IR) is a relatively mature and well-established field. We will introduce the contemporary retrieval models as well as their evaluations.   We will offer Python code examples which contain implementations of many techniques discussed in this course. Homework exercises are designed based on Python to help students acquire practical skills of experimenting with the learned techniques and applying them to solve real-world application problems.  The required background knowledge to take this course is minimal since the it is intended to be mostly self-contained. However, students are expected to have basic knowledge about computer science, particularly some programming language, and be comfortable with some basic concepts in probability and statistics such as conditional probability and parameter estimation.

Efforts may include but is not limited to: required reading, homework assignments, and studying for quizzes.  Class Attendance Policy: Attending every class is mandatory. Class attendance entails being prepared, present, and attentive for the entire class period. Missing class reduces your grade through the following method: Two absences could be excused if you send an email with your explanation BEFORE the beginning of the class. More than two absences (three or above) in total will result in U in the course. For each absence, the student is responsible for catching up with all covered materials and assignments.  Late Submissions:  For assignments, unexcused late submission (according to the Canvas timestamp and the \u201clate\u201d flag) will receive a grade of 0. You should plan sufficiently for completing and submitting assignments. Should an emergency arise that greatly disrupts one\u2019s ability to complete an assignment, please send an email to Dr. Niu before the due date with a plan for submission after the due date. You need to receive Dr. Niu\u2019s permission for late submission.   Special Needs and Religious Accommodation: If you have a documented disability and require accommodation in this course, contact the Office of Disability Services (https:\/\/ds.uncc.edu\/students\/academic) the first week of the semester. Accommodations for learning will be arranged by that office and communicated to the Instructor.  It is the obligation of students to provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of religious observances on which they will be absent by submitting a Request for Religious Accommodation Form to their instructor prior to the census date for enrollment for a given semester. The census date for each semester (typically the tenth day of instruction) can be found in UNC Charlotte\u2019s Academic Calendar (https:\/\/registrar.uncc.edu\/printable-calendar).

This means that there will be no remote \nparticipation option available for students for any reason.  All students must follow the updates \nand instructions  about health  posted on  https:\/\/ninernationcares.charlotte.edu\/ . \n \n \nSyllabus and Class Expectations  \nCourse Description  \nAn overview of the business approach to identifying, modeling, retrieving, sharing, and \nevaluating an enterprise\u2019s data and knowledge assets. Focuses on the understanding of data \nand knowledge management, data warehousing, data mining (including rule -based  systems, \ndecision trees, neural networks, etc.), and other business intelligence concepts. Covers the \norganizational, technological and management perspectives.  \n \nLearning  Objectives  \nBusiness intelligence (BI) is a broad category of applications and technologies for gathering, \nstoring, analyzing, and providing access to data to help enterprise users make better business \ndecisions. BI applications include the activities of decision support systems, query and \nreporting, online analytica l processing (OLAP), statistical analysis, forecasting, and data mining.   \n \n \n \n \n1 This syllabus may be subject to minor changes during the semester after adequate advance notice to students.   \n \n2 \n \n The learning objectives of the course are thus:  \n\u2022 To understand the role of business intelligence and analytics in today\u2019s competitive and \nturbulent business environment.  \n\u2022 To be familiar with the terminology of the field, basic principles, and concepts of \nbusiness intelligence and analytics.  \n\u2022 To learn how to use and apply key methods for analytics (e.g., regression, decision trees, \nclustering, and association rule).  \n   \nCourse Materials  \n\u2022 Handouts, slides, assignments, and online resources will be posted on Canvas.  \n\u2022 Textbook : There are no required textbooks as students will be provided with enough \nmaterials for each topic on Canvas. But, you may find the following texts useful to \nfurther your knowledge in analytics and data science:  \no \u201cAn Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R \u201d by James, Witten, \nHastie, and Tibshirani, ISBN -13: 978 -1461471370  \no \u201cData Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data -\nanalytic thinking\u201d by Provost and Fawcett, ISBN -13: 978 -1449361327  \no \u201cData mining: concepts and techniques\u201d by Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, and \nJian Pei. Elsevier 2011, ISBN -13:978 -0123814791  \n \nBootcamps  \n\u2022 All students registered for this class should complete two bootcamps \u2013 (1) Statistics and \n(2) R.  The statistics bootcamp is available on Canvas and is titled \u201cTraining \u2013 Statistics \nfor Data Science Overview\u201d.  You are automatically enrolled in this Canvas  course.  The R \nbootcamp is  available in DataCamp.  You need to follow the steps below to enroll in the \nR bootcamp in DataCamp:  \na. Register for DataCamp  by filling in  the form present on this website : \nhttps:\/\/dsba.charlotte.edu\/current -students\/sds -bootcamp -courses . \nb. Login to DataCamp using your university email id (use @charlotte.edu).  \nc. Go to Learn \u2192 Tracks \u2192 Organization Tracks.  \nd.

R: 30 points  \n \nLaptop Requirement   \nAll students taking classes from the Belk College of Business and\/or the School of Data Science \nare required to have their own laptop computer. If you are using a work laptop, please make \nsure that your laptop can access the webpages and other materials posted on Canvas and that \nthere are no network access restrictions installed by your workp lace.  If so, you may find having \nyour personal laptop saves a lot of issues relating to doing work in class.  \n  \n \n3 \n \n Grading2: \nComponent  Points  \nExams (2 x 300 points)  \nAssignments  (4 out of 5 assignments)  \nBoot camps  \nClass participation & Attendance  600 points (60%)  \n240 points ( 24%) \n  60 points ( 6%) \n100 points ( 10%) \n \nFinal letter grades will be based on the following total points at the end of semester:  \n900 and above  A (Superior Performance)  \n800-899.99   B (Good Performance)  \n700-799.99   C (Marginal Performance)  \nBelow 700   U (Unsatisfactory)  \n \nCredit Hours  \nThis is a 3 credit hour course.  Thus,  the course has been designed to require on average about \n10 hours\/week (about 3 hours outside of class for every 1 credit hour) between readings, \nquizzes, and exercise\/project work. Of course, the hours may be more or less than indicated \nabove depending on the assignments, cases, exams or project work due.  If a student has \nlimited backgrounds in certain topics, they might need to spend additional time to keep up with \nother students in the course.  \n \nAttendance  \nStudents are expected to attend all class meetings and to arrive before the class starts. Class \ntopics are integrated, with each week building on prior weeks. Failure to arrive on time or \nattend class can adversely affect individual performance, ability to  contribute to class \ndiscussion, in -class assignment s, and the earned letter grade. If a student misses 4 or more \nclasses, they will automatically receive an unsatisfactory U grade in the course regardless of \nearned points to date on other activities . If a  student misses a class due to work or other \nreasons, it is their responsibility to get notes from peers; instructors do not hold extra repeat \nclass sessions.  Also, there will be no make -up for in-class assignments given irrespective of \nwhether your absence is excused or un -excused.    \n \nClass Participation  \nClass attendance will be taken at random in class during the semester. A student\u2019s attendance \npercentage based on this random attendance is factored into the final grade for class \nparticipation. Students are strongly encouraged to have active participation  in class discussions. \nI expect every student to read the textbook and other posted materials prior to each live \nsession.  \n \n  \n \n2 Any changes to the grading components or weights will be at the discretion of the instructor and will be \ncommunicated to the students well in advance.   \n \n4 \n \n Exams  \nThere will be two exams. Exams are closed book and notes when they are administered in class. \nExams may require LockDown  Browser, which will be specified in advance by the instructor. \nExam questions will not be accessible after you take the exams. The instructor will keep all \nexams. However, exam reviews are available during office hours or by appointment for 10 days \nafter exam grades are posted. All exam grades will be posted on Canvas.  No exam reviews are \nallowed after 10 days after the grades are posted.  \n \nMissing an exam without prior approval and\/or providing supporting documentation within the \nfollowing timeframe will lead to a grade of zero for that exam. If the excuse is approved before \nthe exam date (in rare case and requires supporting documentation), the student will be given \na make -up exam. A student who misses an exam without prior approval, possibly due to \nunexpected situation on the exam day, should contact the instructor within 12 hours of the \nexam start date\/time and provide appropriate supporti ng documentation to be eligible for a \nmakeup exam. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of and follow the make -up exam \npolicies and no special accommodations will be made for any exceptions. No makeup exam will \nbe given after the last day of clas s.  \n \nAssignments  \nAll assignments are posted on Canvas and should be submitted on Canvas.  Unless specified by \ninstructor, assignments emailed to the instructor will not be accepted.  Assignments submitted \nafter the due date\/time but within 24 hours of the due date\/time will be graded for a maximum \nof 75% of the original points for that assignment. Assignments submitted after 24 hrs of the due \ndate\/time will receive a grade of zero.  No exceptions are allowed for this late policy.  Als o, this \nlate policy applies only to home work assignments and not to in -class assignments, quizzes and \nexams.   \n \nUnless the assignment clearly specifies otherwise, you must complete each assignment on your \nown. Any sharing of answers between students or submitting someone else\u2019s work as your own \nwill be considered a violation of the Academic Integrity Code and will r esult  in, at a minimum , a \ngrade of zero for the assignment with a possibility for further disciplinary action.  \n  \nQuizzes & In-class Assignments  \nThere will be short quizzes at various points in the semester on topics covered before . There \nmay also be in -class assignments . Once an exam\/quiz  has started and work has been collected, \nlate arrivals cannot make them up. (If one arrives during a quiz, they can immediately start on \nit, bu t no time extension will be given ). Make -up quizzes or in -class assignments are not \nallowed irrespective of whether your absence is excused or un -excused.   Instead, one quiz or \nin-class assignment out of all administered quizzes & in -class assignments  will be dropped for \nthe final grading.  Since the class meets on Tuesdays  evening , please arrange your work or \npersonal activities around this schedule.  \n  \n \n5 \n \n Extra Credit Opportunities  \nDescriptions of extra credit opportunities, if any, will be offered to the entire class and posted \non Canvas.  However, it is strongly encouraged that students do not rely on extra credit to \nimprove their grades as we may end up with very few or no extra c redit opportunities in the \nsemester.  No extra credit will be offered to an individual student for the purpose of improving \nher\/his grades.  Bottom line:   Stay focused throughout the semester and do not miss any \nassignment or test, so you don\u2019t have to rel y on extra credit for improving your grades.  \n \nClass Behavior Policy  \nI will conduct this class in an atmosphere of mutual respect. I encourage your active \nparticipation in class discussions. Each of us may have strongly differing opinions on the various \ntopics of class discussions. The presentation and discussion of differe nt ideas are encouraged \nand welcome. The orderly questioning of the ideas of others, including mine, is similarly \nwelcome. However, I will exercise my responsibility to manage the discussions so that ideas and \nargument can proceed in an orderly fashion. Yo u should expect that if your conduct during class \ndiscussions seriously disrupts the atmosphere of mutual respect I expect in this class, you will \nnot be permitted to participate further.  \n \nUnder no circumstances will students be permitted to spend their class time working on \nassignments for other classes, checking e -mail, or surfing the Web. Attempts to engage in such \nbehavior will be reflected in lower grades and may lead to removal from th e course.  All \nstudents and the instructor are expected to engage with each other respectfully. Unwelcome \nconduct directed toward another person based upon that person\u2019s actual or perceived race, \nactual or perceived gender, color, religion, age, national o rigin, ethnicity, disability, or veteran \nstatus, or for any other reason, may constitute a violation of University Policy 406, The Code of \nStudent Responsibility. Any student suspected of engaging in such conduct will be referred to \nthe Office of Student C onduct.  \n  \nCivility  \nThe University strives to create an inclusive academic climate in which the dignity of all \nindividuals is respected and maintained. We celebrate diversity that is beneficial to both \nemployers and society at large.  Students are strongly encouraged to be respectful and \ncourteous towards others when sharing their views during  class discussions.  \n \nAcademic Integrity\/Honesty  \nStudents have the responsibility to know and observe the requirements of The UNC Charlotte \nCode of Student Academic Integrity  available online at http:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/up -407. This \ncode forbids cheating, fabrication or falsification of information, multiple submissions of academic \nwork, plagiarism  (which includes viewing others work without instructor permission) , abuse of \nacademic materials, and complicity in academic dishonesty.  This forbidding includes \nsharing\/copying work between individuals or teams without permission of instructor s. Any \nspecial requirements or permission regarding academic integrity in this course will be stated by the  \n \n6 \n \n instructor, and are binding on the students.  Students who violate the code can be expelled from \nUNC Charlotte.  The normal penalty for a first offense is zero credit on the work involving \ndishonesty and further substantial reduction of the course grade.  In almost all cases the course \ngrade is reduced to failing .  Students are expected to report cases of academic dishonesty to the \ncourse instructor.  \n \nGrade Appeals  \nIf you believe that the grade you received on an assignment, exam or other graded course \ncomponent was in error or unfair, you can appeal to the professor in writing within 10 calendar \ndays of the receipt of your grade. The appeal should clearly state the reasons why you believe \nthe grade to be unfair or the nature of the error. Overdue appeals will not be considered.  \n  \nIncomplete Grade Policy  \nThe incomplete is not based solely on a student\u2019s failure to complete work or as a means of \nraising his\/her grade by doing additional work after the grade report time. An incomplete grade \ncan be given when a student has a serious medical problem or other e xtenuating circumstance \nthat legitimately prevents completion of required work by the due date. In any case, the \nstudent's work to date should be passing up to the time of the extenuating circumstance, and \nthe student should provide proper written proof (e .g., a doctor's note), in order to get an 'I' \ngrade.  \n \nDisability Accommodations  \nUNC Charlotte is committed to access to education. If you have a disability and need academic \naccommodations, please provide a letter of accommodation from Disability Services early in the \nsemester. For more information on accommodations, contact the Offic e of Disability Services at \n704-687-0040  or visit their office in Fretwell 230.  \n \nAccommodations for Religious Observances  \nUNC  Charlotte provides reasonable accommodations, including a minimum of two excused \nabsences each academic year, for religious observances required by a student\u2019s religious \npractice or belief.   Please refer to https:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/up -409 for details on \nrequesting such accommodations.  \n \nOther Information  \n\uf063 Students are responsible for all announcements made in class or announced via email . The \ninstructors may send some information via Canvas announcements. It is the students \u2019 \nresponsibility to keep up -to-date on the class -related information and to check their \n@uncc.edu email regularly .   \n\uf063 The instructors will discuss grades only  in person (and not via telephone or e -mail) and only \nwith the student (not with parents, spouses, etc). The instructors may not answer student \ne-mails other than related to scheduling appointments .

This means that there will be no remote participation option available for students for any reason.  All students must follow the updates and instructions about health posted on https:\/\/ninernationcares.charlotte.edu\/.   Syllabus and Class Expectations Course Description An overview of the business approach to identifying, modeling, retrieving, sharing, and evaluating an enterprise\u2019s data and knowledge assets. Focuses on the understanding of data and knowledge management, data warehousing, data mining (including rule-based systems, decision trees, neural networks, etc.), and other business intelligence concepts. Covers the organizational, technological and management perspectives.   Learning Objectives Business intelligence (BI) is a broad category of applications and technologies for gathering, storing, analyzing, and providing access to data to help enterprise users make better business decisions. BI applications include the activities of decision support systems, query and reporting, online analytical processing (OLAP), statistical analysis, forecasting, and data mining.        1 This syllabus may be subject to minor changes during the semester after adequate advance notice to students.   \n2   The learning objectives of the course are thus:  \u2022 To understand the role of business intelligence and analytics in today\u2019s competitive and turbulent business environment.  \u2022 To be familiar with the terminology of the field, basic principles, and concepts of business intelligence and analytics.  \u2022 To learn how to use and apply key methods for analytics (e.g., regression, decision trees, clustering, and association rule).     Course Materials  \u2022 Handouts, slides, assignments, and online resources will be posted on Canvas. \u2022 Textbook: There are no required textbooks as students will be provided with enough materials for each topic on Canvas. But, you may find the following texts useful to further your knowledge in analytics and data science: o \u201cAn Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R\u201d by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani, ISBN-13: 978-1461471370 o \u201cData Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking\u201d by Provost and Fawcett, ISBN-13: 978-1449361327 o \u201cData mining: concepts and techniques\u201d by Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, and Jian Pei. Elsevier 2011, ISBN-13:978-0123814791  Bootcamps \u2022 All students registered for this class should complete two bootcamps \u2013 (1) Statistics and (2) R.  The statistics bootcamp is available on Canvas and is titled \u201cTraining \u2013 Statistics for Data Science Overview\u201d.  You are automatically enrolled in this Canvas course.  The R bootcamp is available in DataCamp.  You need to follow the steps below to enroll in the R bootcamp in DataCamp: a. Register for DataCamp by filling in the form present on this website: https:\/\/dsba.charlotte.edu\/current-students\/sds-bootcamp-courses. b. Login to DataCamp using your university email id (use @charlotte.edu). c. Go to Learn \u00e0 Tracks \u00e0 Organization Tracks. d. You will see \u201cSDS R Bootcamp\u201d \u2022 If you complete the Statistics and R bootcamp by Sep 15th you will get credit as follows: a. Statistics: 30 points b. R: 30 points  Laptop Requirement  All students taking classes from the Belk College of Business and\/or the School of Data Science are required to have their own laptop computer. If you are using a work laptop, please make sure that your laptop can access the webpages and other materials posted on Canvas and that there are no network access restrictions installed by your workplace.  If so, you may find having your personal laptop saves a lot of issues relating to doing work in class.    \n3   Grading2: Component Points Exams (2 x 300 points) Assignments (4 out of 5 assignments) Boot camps Class participation & Attendance 600 points (60%) 240 points (24%) 60 points (6%)  100 points (10%)  Final letter grades will be based on the following total points at the end of semester:  900 and above  A (Superior Performance) 800-899.99   B (Good Performance)  700-799.99   C (Marginal Performance) Below 700   U (Unsatisfactory)  Credit Hours This is a 3 credit hour course. Thus, the course has been designed to require on average about 10 hours\/week (about 3 hours outside of class for every 1 credit hour) between readings, quizzes, and exercise\/project work. Of course, the hours may be more or less than indicated above depending on the assignments, cases, exams or project work due.  If a student has limited backgrounds in certain topics, they might need to spend additional time to keep up with other students in the course.   Attendance Students are expected to attend all class meetings and to arrive before the class starts. Class topics are integrated, with each week building on prior weeks. Failure to arrive on time or attend class can adversely affect individual performance, ability to contribute to class discussion, in-class assignments, and the earned letter grade. If a student misses 4 or more classes, they will automatically receive an unsatisfactory U grade in the course regardless of earned points to date on other activities. If a student misses a class due to work or other reasons, it is their responsibility to get notes from peers; instructors do not hold extra repeat class sessions.  Also, there will be no make-up for in-class assignments given irrespective of whether your absence is excused or un-excused.    Class Participation  Class attendance will be taken at random in class during the semester. A student\u2019s attendance percentage based on this random attendance is factored into the final grade for class participation. Students are strongly encouraged to have active participation in class discussions. I expect every student to read the textbook and other posted materials prior to each live session.     Exams  2 Any changes to the grading components or weights will be at the discretion of the instructor and will be communicated to the students well in advance.   \n4   There will be two exams. Exams are closed book and notes when they are administered in class. Exams may require LockDown Browser, which will be specified in advance by the instructor. Exam questions will not be accessible after you take the exams. The instructor will keep all exams. However, exam reviews are available during office hours or by appointment for 10 days after exam grades are posted. All exam grades will be posted on Canvas.  No exam reviews are allowed after 10 days after the grades are posted.  Missing an exam without prior approval and\/or providing supporting documentation within the following timeframe will lead to a grade of zero for that exam. If the excuse is approved before the exam date (in rare case and requires supporting documentation), the student will be given a make-up exam. A student who misses an exam without prior approval, possibly due to unexpected situation on the exam day, should contact the instructor within 12 hours of the exam start date\/time and provide appropriate supporting documentation to be eligible for a makeup exam. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of and follow the make-up exam policies and no special accommodations will be made for any exceptions. No makeup exam will be given after the last day of class.   Assignments  All assignments are posted on Canvas and should be submitted on Canvas.  Unless specified by instructor, assignments emailed to the instructor will not be accepted.  Assignments submitted after the due date\/time but within 24 hours of the due date\/time will be graded for a maximum of 75% of the original points for that assignment. Assignments submitted after 24 hrs of the due date\/time will receive a grade of zero.  No exceptions are allowed for this late policy.  Also, this late policy applies only to homework assignments and not to in-class assignments, quizzes and exams.    Unless the assignment clearly specifies otherwise, you must complete each assignment on your own. Any sharing of answers between students or submitting someone else\u2019s work as your own will be considered a violation of the Academic Integrity Code and will result in, at a minimum, a grade of zero for the assignment with a possibility for further disciplinary action.   Quizzes & In-class Assignments There will be short quizzes at various points in the semester on topics covered before. There may also be in-class assignments. Once an exam\/quiz has started and work has been collected, late arrivals cannot make them up. (If one arrives during a quiz, they can immediately start on it, but no time extension will be given). Make-up quizzes or in-class assignments are not allowed irrespective of whether your absence is excused or un-excused.  Instead, one quiz or in-class assignment out of all administered quizzes & in-class assignments will be dropped for the final grading.  Since the class meets on Tuesdays evening, please arrange your work or personal activities around this schedule.     \n5   Extra Credit Opportunities Descriptions of extra credit opportunities, if any, will be offered to the entire class and posted on Canvas.  However, it is strongly encouraged that students do not rely on extra credit to improve their grades as we may end up with very few or no extra credit opportunities in the semester.  No extra credit will be offered to an individual student for the purpose of improving her\/his grades.  Bottom line:  Stay focused throughout the semester and do not miss any assignment or test, so you don\u2019t have to rely on extra credit for improving your grades.  Class Behavior Policy  I will conduct this class in an atmosphere of mutual respect. I encourage your active participation in class discussions. Each of us may have strongly differing opinions on the various topics of class discussions. The presentation and discussion of different ideas are encouraged and welcome. The orderly questioning of the ideas of others, including mine, is similarly welcome. However, I will exercise my responsibility to manage the discussions so that ideas and argument can proceed in an orderly fashion. You should expect that if your conduct during class discussions seriously disrupts the atmosphere of mutual respect I expect in this class, you will not be permitted to participate further.   Under no circumstances will students be permitted to spend their class time working on assignments for other classes, checking e-mail, or surfing the Web. Attempts to engage in such behavior will be reflected in lower grades and may lead to removal from the course.  All students and the instructor are expected to engage with each other respectfully. Unwelcome conduct directed toward another person based upon that person\u2019s actual or perceived race, actual or perceived gender, color, religion, age, national origin, ethnicity, disability, or veteran status, or for any other reason, may constitute a violation of University Policy 406, The Code of Student Responsibility. Any student suspected of engaging in such conduct will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct.   Civility The University strives to create an inclusive academic climate in which the dignity of all individuals is respected and maintained. We celebrate diversity that is beneficial to both employers and society at large. Students are strongly encouraged to be respectful and courteous towards others when sharing their views during class discussions.  Academic Integrity\/Honesty Students have the responsibility to know and observe the requirements of The UNC Charlotte Code of Student Academic Integrity available online at http:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/up-407. This code forbids cheating, fabrication or falsification of information, multiple submissions of academic work, plagiarism (which includes viewing others work without instructor permission), abuse of academic materials, and complicity in academic dishonesty.  This forbidding includes sharing\/copying work between individuals or teams without permission of instructors. Any special requirements or permission regarding academic integrity in this course will be stated by the instructor, and are   \n6   binding on the students.  Students who violate the code can be expelled from UNC Charlotte.  The normal penalty for a first offense is zero credit on the work involving dishonesty and further substantial reduction of the course grade.  In almost all cases the course grade is reduced to failing.  Students are expected to report cases of academic dishonesty to the course instructor.   Grade Appeals  If you believe that the grade you received on an assignment, exam or other graded course component was in error or unfair, you can appeal to the professor in writing within 10 calendar days of the receipt of your grade. The appeal should clearly state the reasons why you believe the grade to be unfair or the nature of the error. Overdue appeals will not be considered.   Incomplete Grade Policy  The incomplete is not based solely on a student\u2019s failure to complete work or as a means of raising his\/her grade by doing additional work after the grade report time. An incomplete grade can be given when a student has a serious medical problem or other extenuating circumstance that legitimately prevents completion of required work by the due date. In any case, the student's work to date should be passing up to the time of the extenuating circumstance, and the student should provide proper written proof (e.g., a doctor's note), in order to get an 'I' grade.   Disability Accommodations UNC Charlotte is committed to access to education. If you have a disability and need academic accommodations, please provide a letter of accommodation from Disability Services early in the semester. For more information on accommodations, contact the Office of Disability Services at 704-687-0040 or visit their office in Fretwell 230.  Accommodations for Religious Observances  UNC Charlotte provides reasonable accommodations, including a minimum of two excused absences each academic year, for religious observances required by a student\u2019s religious practice or belief.  Please refer to https:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/up-409 for details on requesting such accommodations.  Other Information c Students are responsible for all announcements made in class or announced via email. The instructors may send some information via Canvas announcements. It is the students\u2019 responsibility to keep up-to-date on the class-related information and to check their @uncc.edu email regularly.   c The instructors will discuss grades only in person (and not via telephone or e-mail) and only with the student (not with parents, spouses, etc). The instructors may not answer student e-mails other than related to scheduling appointments. Office hours are posted in the syllabus on page 1.  c The instructors may modify the class schedule and syllabus during the course of the semester depending upon the progress of the class.    \n7    The University of North Carolina Charlotte and the Belk College of Business strive to create an inclusive academic climate in which the dignity of all individuals is respected and maintained. Therefore, we celebrate diversity that includes, but is not limited to ability\/disability, age, culture, ethnicity, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socio-economic status.

The official overall grade is computed and kept in the instructor\u2019s grade book.  \n \nExams  \nThere will be two exams  (300 points) , which  will be  closed  book and notes  when they are \nadministered in class . There will also be an optional comprehensive final exam. Student may take and \nuse it to replace the lowest grade from the two exams. Please be advised that if you do not take the \nfinal exam, your final grade will reflect your performance on the first two  exams and other course \nelements.  The submission type of both exams is individual. Collaboration between or among students \nare prohibited and students must follow UNC Charlotte\u2019s Code of Student Academic Integrity \n(https:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/up -407 ).  \n \nExams may require LockDown Browser, which will be specified in advance by the instructor. The \nexams may contain material that is not in the  slides or handouts but would be covered in the class. \nExam questions will not be accessible after you take the exams. The instructor will keep all exams. \nHowever, exam reviews are available during office hours or by appointment for 10 days after exam grades are posted. All exam grades will be posted on Canvas.  \n \nMissed exams: In the event that an  excuse d absence  with proper supporting documentation  is \napproved before the exam time , the student will be given a make- up exam. Missing an exam without \nprior approval or without providing proper supporting documentation will receive a grade of zero for that exam. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of and follow the attendance and \nparticipation policy and no special accommodations will be made for any exceptions. No makeup \nexam will be given after the last day of class.  3 \n Assignments  \nThere will be five individual assignments (1 10 points) throughout the semester. All assignments are \nposted on Canvas and should be submitted on Canvas.  Unless specified by instructor, assignments \nemailed to the instructor will not be accepted.  Assignments are due at class start time  on the due date. \nIn the case of a late submission within 24 hours of the due date\/time, the assignment will be graded \nfor a maximum of 8 0% of the original points  for that assignment . Assignments submitted after 24 \nhours of the due date\/time will receive a grade of zero.  No exceptions are allowed for this  late policy.   \n \nAll the homework assignments will be individual based  unless the assignment clearly specifies \notherwise . Each student must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned homework. A student \nmay not share his\/her answers with another student or copy (by any means) another's work (or \nportions of it) and represent it as his\/her own. These academic misconduct will result in a grade of \nzero for the assignment at a minimum with a possibility for further di sciplinary action.  \n \nBootcamp C ourses  \nThere are two bootcamp courses you need to take for this course.  \n\u2022 Overview of Statistics for Data Science ( 12 pts)  \nYou can complete each module in the course or pass the comprehensive assessment and get a completion certificate. Only then will you get credit for the above full points in this class.   \nEstimated time required for completion is 10 hours.  \n\u2022 Introduction to R for Data Science ( 8 pts)  \nYou must complete Modules 1 -4 to get credit for the above full points in this class. Estimated \ntime required for completion is 4 hours.  \nYou are required to complete these courses by January 31. However, it is recommended to \ncomp lete these as soon as possible. There is no need to submit your certificates. The information \nwill be obtained directly from the School of Data Science TA.  \n \nClass Participation  \nClass participation consists of class attendance ( 5 pts), class discussion ( 5 pts), article presentation \n(5 pts) , and in -class assignments (1 5 pts) . Students are strongly encouraged to engage actively in class \ndiscussion, such as asking\/answering questions and sharing real -life and work experiences related to \nthe course topics.  A student will lose 3 points if he\/she never participated in class discussion.  \n Students are expected to attend every class on time and to stay for the duration of the class.  Class \nattendance will be taken at random in class during the semester. Failure to attend class or arriving \nlate may impact your ability to achieve course objectives. A student\u2019s attendance percentage based \non this random attendance is factored into the final grade for class attendance. For a class to be \nconsidered an excused absence, a printed \/electronic note from the related authority is required \nwithin one week of the missed class. Tardiness or early departure is strongly discouraged in this class. \nStudents who arrive more than 10 minutes late or leave lecture before it is c omplete without notifying \nthe instructor prior to the start of class will receive a reduction in their overall class participation grade.  \n An absence, excused or unexcused, does not relieve a student of any course requirement. Regular \nclass attendance is a student\u2019s obligation, as is a responsibility for all the work of class meetings, including tests and written tasks. You are responsible for all lecture material regardless of whether \nyou attend each class. If a student misses a class due to work or other  reasons, it is their responsibility \nto get notes from peers. Instructors do not hold extra repeat class sessions, and  office hours are not \nto be used as a substitute for class attendance.  4 \n To expose  students  to the breadth of business intelligence and analytics and to promote knowledge \nsharing, student s will be organized into two- person groups by the instructor and each group is \nexpected to give a short presentation ( ~5 min utes) on a case study or a selected article on business \nanalytics published since 2017.  \n\u2022 The presentations will be scheduled throughout the semester by the instructor. \n\u2022 The presentation will be based on your selected article from an academic or trade journal or \na conference that has used business analytics to solve a real- world problem using one or more \ndatasets. The article or case study should contain significant content.  \n\u2022 Your presentation is expected to cover problem context , methods , and findings  from the \nselected article.   \n\u2022 You can search related articles from the UNCC library web portal and\/or Google Scholar using keyword search.  \n\u2022 You are encouraged to prepare a presentation file in support of your presentation. The file should be submitted to Canvas by 5: 00pm on the scheduled date o f your presentation .   \n \nThere will be in -class assignments, including unscheduled discussion  assignments and short \nquizzes at various points in the semester on topics covered before. Once an exam\/quiz has started and work has been collected, late arrivals cannot make them up. (If one arrives during a quiz, they \ncan immediately start on it, but no time extens ion will be given). Make -up quizzes or in -class \nassignments are not allowed irrespective of whether your absence is excused or un -excused.   \nOne quiz out of all administered quizzes will be dropped for the final grading.  Since the class meets \non Tuesday evening s, please arrange your work or personal activities around this schedule.  \n \nGroup Project  \nStudents will form a group of three  members to complete a group project. Each group will select a \ntopic on its own that applies business analytical techniques. The group project consists of three \ndeliverables: group formation  (5 points) , proposal  (15 points) , and presentation  (30 points) . All \nproject deliverables are due at the beginning of the class on the scheduled dates and should  be \nsubmitted to course canvas. Detailed group project and presentation instructions will be provided as \na separate document on Canvas. If necessary, peer reviews will be factored into the grade.  \n \nImportant Information and Class Policies  \nLaptop and Webcam Requirement s \nAll upper -level (including graduate level) business students are required to have their own \npersonal laptop computer. The policy and the minimum system requirements are found at the \nlink https:\/\/belkcollege.uncc.edu\/laptop -policy . Students in the DSBA program are required to \nfollow the laptop policy here . \n \nExtra Credit Opportunities  \nExtra -credit opportunities, if any, will be the instructor's decision and such opportunities will be \npresented to the whole class instead of individual students only. It is strongly encouraged that \nstudents do not rely on extra credit to improve their grad es later in the semester.  \n \nUse of Canvas  \nCanvas will be the website for course information and primary communication channel for this class. \nYou may access UNCC Canvas from My UNC Charlotte ( https:\/\/my.uncc.edu\/ ) or direct type \ncanvas.uncc.edu . Students are responsible for all announcements made in class or announced via 5 \n email  and on canvas . The instruct ors may send some information via Canvas announcements. It is the \nstudents \u2019 responsibility to keep up -to-date on the class -related information and to check their \n@uncc.edu email and Canvas regularly.  It\u2019s each student\u2019s responsibility to report anything t hat does \nnot match your own record (e.g., missing or wrong grade) within 10 calendar days since the date of \ninformation posting.  \n \nTeam Work  \nFor group activities, each team is responsible for organizing itself, dividing up the work, and deciding \nhow relati ve contributions should be measured. It is your responsibility to promptly inform the \ninstructor of any dysfunctional team dynamics and to solicit his help.  \nAll team members must  \n\u2022 participate in all team activities equally,  \n\u2022 strive to maintain positive working relationships with other team members,  \n\u2022 assist team members to resolve issues relating to group work, and  \n\u2022 freely express their ideas, thoughts, comments, and constructive criticisms to their team members, me, and the class.  \nIt is the responsibility of the team to ensure that all team members understand all concepts related to the completed projects and presentations.  \n \nAcademic Integrity  \nUniversity regulations will be strictly enforced in all cases of academic irregularities, cheating or \nplagiarism or  any variations thereof. Students assume full responsibility for the content and integrity \nof the academic work they submit. The guiding principle of academic integrity shall be that a student's submitted work, examinations, reports, and projects must be h is\/her own or own group work.  \nStudents have the responsibility to know and observe the requirements of The UNC Charlotte Code of \nStudent Academic Integrity  available online at http:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/poli cies\/up -407. This code forbids \ncheating, fabrication or falsification of information, multiple submissions of academic work, plagiarism (which includes viewing others work without instructor permission), abuse of academic materials, and \ncomplicity in acade mic dishonesty.  This forbidding includes sharing\/copying work between \nindividuals or teams without permission of instructors.  Any special requirements or permission \nregarding academic integrity in this course will be stated by the instructor, and are bind ing on the \nstudents.  Students who violate the code can be expelled from UNC Charlotte.  The normal penalty for a \nfirst offense is zero credit on the work involving dishonesty and further substantial reduction of the \ncourse grade.  In almost all cases the course grade is reduced to failing.  Students are expected to report \ncases of academic dishonesty to the course instructor.  \nAny further specific requirements or permission regarding academic integrity in this course will be \nstated by the instructor, and a re also binding on the students in this course.  \n \nIncomplete Grade Policy  \nReceiving a grade of incomplete (\u201cI\u201d) is not based solely on a student\u2019s failure to complete work or as \na means of raising his\/her grade by doing additional work after the grade report time. As per \nuniversity policy , incomplete grades will be granted when a student who is otherwise passing has not, \ndue to circumstances beyond his\/her control, completed all the work in the course. The missing work must be completed and the final grade reported within one calendar year from the date on which the \n\u201cI\u201d grade was recorded. The instructor assigning the \u201cI\u201d grade may specify a shorter time than one \nyear for completion of the work and the assignment of a final grade. If the \u201cI\u201d is not removed during \nthe specified time, a grade of \u201cF\u201d, \u201cU\u201d, or \u201cN\u201d, as appropriate is automatically assigned. Time extensions \nfor the completion of an \u201cI\u201d beyond one year cannot be approved except by special request  to the 6 \n Graduate School under extraordinary circumstances. The grade of \u201cI\u201d cannot be removed by enrolling \nagain in the same course, and students should not re -enroll in a course in which they have been \nassigned the grade of \u201cI\u201d.  \n \nGrade Appeals Policy  \nIf you believe that the grade you received on an assignment or an exam was in error or unfair, you \ncan appeal to the professor in writing within 10 calendar days of posting the grades . The appeal \nshould clearly state the reasons why you believe the grade to be unfair or the nature of the error. \nOverdue appeals will not be considered.

In addition, students are expected to receive an average of 65% in the three exams in order to receive a grade of C or better.    Assignments:  Problem Solving Assignments These assignments will involve the use of concepts discussed and taught in class. Assignments must be submitted through Canvas; submission of electronic copies by e-mail or disk is not acceptable. Your NAME and ID should appear on the top of each page that you submit. All assignments should be completed on time and submitted on Canvas before the submission deadline as shown on Canvas.  Students violating these policies will be marked for disruptive behavior and may be asked to leave the class. Their grade will also be affected according to the rules of class participation points (pages 2 and 3 of this document).  Accommodation for Disabilities  In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), all qualified students enrolled in this course are entitled to \u201creasonable accommodations.\u201d Please notify the instructor during the first week of class of any accommodations needed for the course.  Academic integrity As a program that helps to create business and government leaders, the College of Business has an obligation to ensure academic integrity is of the highest standards. Standards of academic integrity will be enforced in this course.  University regulations will be strictly enforced in all cases of academic irregularities, cheatingor plagiarism or any variations thereof. Students assume full responsibility for the content and integrity of the academic work they submit. The guiding principle of academic integrity shall bethat a student's submitted work, examinations, reports, and projects must be that of the student's own work.   All UNCC students have the responsibility to be familiar with and to observe the requirements of The UNCC Code of Student Academic Integrity (see the MBAD\/DSBA 6201 Spring 2023  Syllabus  \n01\/10\/2023 5  \n Catalog). This code forbids cheating, fabrication or falsification of information, multiple submission of academic work, plagiarism of written materials and software projects, abuse of academic materials (such as Library books on reserve), and complicity in academic dishonesty (helping others to violate the code). Additional examples of violation of the Code include:  \u2022 Representing the work of others as your own.  For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions of computing techniques. General advice and interactions are encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned homework and laboratory exercises. Students may not \"work together\" on graded assignments. Such collaboration constitutes cheating, unless it is a group assignment. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his\/her own. If you need help on an assignment, contact your instructor or the TA, not other classmates.  Any further specific requirements or permission regarding academic integrity in this course will be stated by the instructor and are also binding on the students in this course. Students who violate the code can be punished to the extent of being permanently expelled from UNCC and having this fact recorded on their official transcripts. The normal penalty is zero credit on the work involving dishonesty and further substantial reduction of the course grade. In almost all cases, the course grade is reduced to \"F.\" If you are unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an honor code violation, you should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation.  If you do not have a copy of the code, you can obtain one from the Dean of Students Office.  Students are expected to report cases of academic dishonesty they become aware of to the course instructor who is responsible for dealing with them.  Feel free to discuss the definition of cheating and\/or plagiarism with me if you are unclear on these terms or have questions about the acceptability of a particular type of action.

The objective of the Homework is for students to solve quantitative problems to prepare for the exams. \nAdditionally, exam problems, in some cases, are similar to homework problems.  \nGroup Assignments:  \nThere are two  group assignments: Case Discussions and Research on Topics in Supply Chain Management . \n \nThe instructor will ask for group suggestions or assign you to a group by the second  week of class. Each group will \nhave 3 -5 students. Consider work ing with different class members to  build connections with each other  and expand \nyour network. During the course, the instructor will seek input from group members regarding the contribution of each group member's participation in  each group assignment. Feedback will be incorporated into determining each \nmember's assignment scores. Details of the peer feedback process are listed below.  \n \nHarvard Business Review Case Discussions:  \n1. Part I. Read and analyze the cases and submit your answers\/analysis using the template provided in Canvas.  \n2. Part II. Read the summarized analyses of the cases and submit your responses to all questions in the analyses for two groups in Canvas b y the due date. Group analyses will be available the morning after they are due.  \n3. The instructor will discuss the case in class to maximize feedback and learning. Please review your team's \nanalysis and responses, as the instructor may ask groups to comment on their submissions.  \n4. Submissions will be graded on completeness and accuracy.  Please be courteous in your response.  \n \nFinal Project:  \nThe project's objective  is to apply what you have learned in class to industries and practices of your choosing or \nexplore more topics related to e- commerce and supply chain management. There are three options for your final \nproject: \n 1. Case study: Choose an organization and analyze its supply chain strategies and practices.  \n2. Comparative study: You can compare and contrast two organizations competing in the same industry (or \nclosely related industries) with different supply chain strategies . \n3. Other topics: Explore topics that are not covered in the syllabus.  \n Submissions include:  \na) A proposal: a problem you want to solve, or a process you want to improve, and the topic or possible \nsolution you wish to research.  \nb) An 8-10 page single -spaced summary of findings using MLA or APA references . Consider placing \nsupporting material in the appendix and referencing it in the document.  \nc) A presentation file (e.g., PowerPoint) to be used for a class presentation at the end of the semester  \n \nSubmissions are to be uploaded to Canvas by the due dates.  \n \n   Option 1: Case Study  \nChoose an organization and analyze its supply chain strategy and practice. The organization can be one you know \nwell or would like to learn more about. When choosing a company (or an operating unit) to study, please consider \nhow you will access data to evaluate the company 's supply chain strategy. When you complete your analyses , you \ncan draw upon secondary data (e.g., company annual reports, analyst reports, articles from the press) and primary \ndata (e.g., interviews, personal experience with the company). You may select a company that we have studied in \nclass , but if you do this , you must examine an issue (or issues) different from what we discuss ed in class. Please \nremember that the best studies offer compelling reasoning and facts to support those opinions.  \n \nThe case study should consist of the following two parts:  \n1. Background about the organization:  \na. A description of the company (or operating unit) and its competitive environment  \nb. Brief historical information , if applicable  \nc. A description of the company' s existing supply chain strategy and practice  \nd. An overview of the company' s supply chain objectives and challenges  \n 2. Analysis and Recommendation (This part should center on the supply chain objectives and challenges identified in part 1)  \na. An evaluation of the company 's supply chain strategy and practice by drawing on the concepts covered in \nthe course  \nb. Identify strengths and weaknesses in the company' s supply chain strategy and practice .  \nc. A recommendation for improvement (this could involve several options to tackle the weaknesses or \nchallenges the company faces in managing its supply chain)  \nd. Discuss how the company will implement this improvement plan (i.e., how the company will build the \nnecessary supply chain capabilities)  \n \nOption 2: Comparative Study  Identify two organizations competing in the same industry (or closely related industries) that have different supply \nchain strategies and practices you can compare and contrast. The organizations can be ones you know well or would \nlike to learn more about. When choosin g companies (or operating units) to study,  please think about how you will \naccess data to evaluate the companies ' supply chain strategies. When you complete your analyses , you can draw \nupon secondary data (e.g., company annual reports, analyst reports, articles from the press) and primary data (e.g., \ninterviews, personal experience with the company). You may select a company that we have studied in class, but if \nyou do this , you must examine an issue (or issues) different from what we discuss ed in class. Please remember that \nthe best studies offer compelling reasoning and facts to support those opinions.  \n \nThe comparative study should consist of the following three parts:  1. Background about the industry  \na. A description of the industry and the primary  competitors  \nb. Brief historical information , if applicable  \nc. Overview of industry trends on supply chain practices  \n2. Background about each organization:  \na. A description of the company (or an operating unit)  \nb. Brief historical information , if applicable  \nc. A description of the company' s existing supply chain strategy and practice  \nd. An overview of the company' s supply chain objectives and challenges  \n \n3. Analysis and Recommendation (This part should center on the supply chain objectives and challenges identified in \npart 2)  \na. A comparison of each company' s supply chain strategy and practice by drawing on the concepts covered in the \ncourse. You do not need to compare all dimensions ; instead, focus on the most relevant aspects  (e.g., different). \nDepth of analysis is preferred over a broad but shallow paper.  \nb. Contrast the strengths and weaknesses in each company' s supply chain strategy and practice.  \nc. Recommend how the organizations may improve their supply chain practices  to compete more effectively \nagainst each other (or in the marketplace).   d. You may comment on how the companies may implement your improvement plan (i.e., how the companies \nwill build the necessary supply chain capabilities). Although t his part is not required , it can help support your \nanalysis.  \n \nOption 3: Other topics  \nExplor e topics that are not covered in the syllabus. Example topics may include but are not limited to the following:  \n\u2022 Supply chain risk and disruption management  \n\u2022 Supply chain finance  \n\u2022 Data -driven supply chain analytics  \n\u2022 Sustainable and socially responsible supply chain management  \n\u2022 And other topics  \n \nProject Participation , Peer Feedback Policy  amd Attendance  \nIt is critical to the group's success that no group member free -rides  on the efforts of the other group members.   The \nfollowing specific procedure will be used to ensure fair grading for group work.   Please read it carefully and let me \nknow if you have  questions or concerns.  \n  \nPeer feedback process : At the end of each group assignment, each student will be allowed to provide participation \nfeedback for each group member voluntarily.   The feedback form is available in the module for each group \nassignment. The feedback score is calculated on a scale from 1 to 10. If you do not want to provide this feedback, I will assume that you have given each group member a total participation score of 10. The feedback received from the group for each team member will be averaged. If only some group members give feedback and others don't, I \nwill assume a participation score of 10 for the non -reporting members.   Students who receive an average \nparticipation score of less than 4 out of 10 will get a ZERO for that group assignment, regardless of the group grade. \nStudents w ith an average feedback score > = 4 and < 7 will receive the original group grade times the average \nfeedback score \/ 10.   Students with an average feedback score > = 7 will receive 100% of the original group grade. \nThe above feedback policy will apply only to group work grades.  \n  \nPlease take the above policy seriously since unsatisfactory feedback due to inadequate or lack of participation in the \ngroup work may reduce your overall course grade by a letter grade. At a minimum, you should be in touch with all \nyour team members. Each team member is responsible for proactively engaging and working with others.   Do not \nwait for someone from the team to pursue or engage with you actively for the project work . Please contact  me if you \nneed clarification regarding the group feedback policy. If there are issues, you must resolve them with your group. If you cannot work it out, please have your group schedule a meeting with me to discuss the issue. Please note that the \ngroup has  the final decision on how to proceed.  \n \nWhen you miss class, you miss essential information. If you are absent, you are responsible for learning the material \ncovered in class. If you have an excused absence, you can make up coursework or complete an equivalent assignment \nagreed upon with me.  \n\u2022 Send me an email informing me of your absence as soon as possible. Include appropriate evidence of your circumstances.  \n\u2022 Verify your absence at: https:\/\/sass.charlotte.edu\/services\/absence -verification\n \n\u2022 Once I receive notification from the university that your evidence has been verified (which may take several days), I will decide (it is not automatic) on excusal and contact you for make -up arrangements as needed.  \nIt is understood that life happens, and you will need to make adjustments to your schedule. Communication with me is vital to achieving full class participation and attendance credit.  \n \nGeneral Guidelines for Submissions to Instructor:  \n1. Submissions must be submitted on the Course Canvas website by the required date by clicking the assignment \nupload link and the submit button.  \n2. Please combine work into a single file in the order of the questions\/problems.  \n3. Email attachments will not be accepted for assignments unless authorized by the instructor.  \n4. For group assignments, only one submission per  group is required. Please ensure you coordinate who will submit \nyour group's work.  Note that subsequent submissions will overwrite the previous version. If submitting more than \none document, please submit all documents simultaneously.  \n5. Use standard software applications such as Microsoft Word or Excel to create your documents for submission.  \nPlease do not submit Acrobat (pdf) files.  \n6. Follow a consistent scheme for naming your submission files. Use your group number and then the document  name for consistency.   \n7. Use identifiers such as HW for Homework and chapter number to identify a particular chapter's Homework.  \n8. Include your names and group number s in the document.  \n9. No assignment later than one day will be accepted without prior authorization from the instructor . \n \n   Class Cancellation:  \nIf the instructor cannot attend class or the University is closed unexpectedly, assume the course material will be \nmoved forward to the next meeting. If the course moves to an online format, unforeseen technical issues may \nprevent the instructor or a student from continuing. If the instructor cannot continue after 15 minutes due to \ntechnical problems, that session will end, and the materials will be pushed to the following session. If students cannot continue in the class due to technical issues, they must inform the instructor via email as soon as possible.   \nThe student is additionally responsible for getting any class notes from classmates.  \n \nClass Conduct:  \nDisruptive behavior in the class distracts other students' ability to benefit from the in- class experience and will not \nbe tolerated. Please keep all electronic and telecom equipment , such as cell phones, tablets, beepers, etc. , on \"silent\" \nmode during class and sidebar conversations to a minimum.  \n \nExtra Credit Work:  \nNo EXTRA CREDIT work will be offered for any individual or group during the semester. Please do not \nrequest any extra credit opportunities to improve your grade later in the semester.  \n \nNotes:  \n1. Additional homework\/cases may be assigned in class  \n2. There may be other required readings that are not listed in the syllabus and that will be assigned during the \nsemester. It is essential  to check the Canvas Course website regularly to keep apprised of assigned homework \nproblems and revisions to this syllabus.  \n \nGeneral Policies:  \n \nStudent Academic Integrity:  \nIntegrity is amongst the core values of the Belk College of Business. Students are responsible for knowing and \nobserving the UNC Charlotte Code of Student Integrity (http:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/up -407). All work on exams \nand quizzes is to be done individually. This requirement may also be extended to specific assignments and will be specified in class. There is always the possibility and temptation to consult with someone who has had the course (or class) previously or to consult case\/class notes or project re ports from another section or a previous year or semester \nor that might be available on the I nternet. This practice is strictly prohibited under all circumstances and \nunequivocally violates the Code of Student Integrit y. Group  projects involve a cooperative effort, and everyone is \nrequired to contribute to the assignment. The peer evaluations after each group assignment provide an opportunity to assess individual group members' contributions.   \n \nFor this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in discussing computing techniques, and general advice and interactions are encouraged. Students may not \"work together\" on graded assignments, as such collaboration \nconstitutes cheating unless it is a  group assignment. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work \n(or portions of it) and represent it as their own. If you need help on an assignment, contact your instructor or the TA, not other classmates. Any further requirements or permis sion regarding academic integrity in this course will \nbe stated by the instructor and are binding on the students in this course. Please review the Academic Integrity \nmodule in Canvas for additional information.  \n \nOwnership of Course Materials:  \nThe instructor's lectures and course materials, including presentations, tests, quizzes, exams, videos, outlines, and \nsimilar materials, are protected by copyright. The instructor is the exclusive copyright owner for those materials \ncreated by the instructor. You are encouraged to take notes and make copies of course materials for your own educational use. However, you may not, nor may you knowingly allow others to reproduce or distribute course \nmaterials publicly without the instructor's express written consen t. This requirement includes providing materials to \ncommercial course material suppliers such as CourseHero, Chegg, etc. and other similar services. Students who \npublicly distribute or display or help others publicly distribute or display copies or modifie d copies of the \ninstructor's materials may be in violation of University Policy 406, the Code of Student Responsibility.  \n \n   Diversity and Inclusion:  \nThe Belk College of Business strives to create an inclusive academic climate in which the dignity of all individuals \nis respected and maintained. Therefore, we celebrate the diversity that includes but is not limited to , \nability\/disability, age, culture, ethnicity, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status.  \n \nDisability Accommodations:  \nStudents in this course seeking accommodations for  disabilities must first consult with the Office of Disability \nServices and follow the instructions of that office for obtaining accommodations. If you have a disability that \nqualifies you for academic accommodations, please provide a letter of accommodati on from the Office of Disability \nServices during the first week of class. For more information regarding accommodations, please contact  the Office \nof Disability Services at (704) 687- 4355 or stop by their office at  230 Fretwell.  \n \nReligious Accommodation for Students:  \nThe instructor will observe University Policy \u2013  409 on matters of religious accommodation. Please note that the \nprocedure prescribed by this policy requires a notice to the instructor prior to the semester's census date \n(typically, the tenth day of the instruction).  \n \nWithdrawal from Class:  \nThe administration of this institution has set deadlines for withdrawal from any college -level courses. These dates \nand times are published in that semester's course catalog. Administration procedures must be followed. It is the student's responsibility to handle withdrawal requirements from any class. In other words, the instructor cannot drop \nor withdraw any student. You must do the proper paperwork to ensure that you will not receive a final grade of \" U\" \nin a course if you choose not to attend the class once you are enrolled.  The last day to withdraw from a course \n(grade subject to Withdrawal Policy) is Oct ober 1 5 2024. \n \nIncomplete Grade:  \nAs per university policy, incomplete grades will be granted when a student who is otherwise passing has not, due to \ncircumstances beyond his\/her control, completed all the work in the course. The missing work must be completed by the deadline specified by the instructor or during the next semester (fall or spring) in residence but no later than 12 \nmonths after the term in which the \"I\" grade was assigned, whichever comes first. If the \"I\" grade is not removed \nduring the specified time, a grade of F, U or N as appropriate,  is automatically assigned. The grade of \"I\" cannot be \nremoved by enrolling again in the same course.   \n \nCourse Changes Disclaimer:  \nThe schedule and assignments in this course are subject to change in the event of extenuating circumstances and at \nthe instructor's discretion.  \n \n   DSBA 6208\/MBAD 6208 Course Schedule  \nFall 2024 \nThursdays  5:30- 8:15 PM  \n \nWeek  Date  Topic  Assignment  Due \nDate  \n \n1  \n8\/22 Introduction to the Course  \nIntroduction to Supply Chain Management    \n \n2  \n8\/29 Strategic Fit, Supply Chain Drivers and Metrics,  \nDesigning Distribution Strategies  Group Suggestions \nDue   9\/1 \n3 9\/5 Demand Forecasting    \n4 9\/12 Case 1 Review  - Amazon  \nSupply Chain Contracts and Channel Coordination  \nSales and Operations Planning  Case 1 Analysis  \nCase 1 Response  \nHomework # 1  9\/8 \n9\/10 \n9\/15 \n5 9\/19 Exam 1 - Chapters 1 -4, 7, 9, and 10    \n6 9\/26 Cycle Inventory Management    \n7 10\/3 Safety Inventory Management  Final Project \nProposal  10\/6 \n8 10\/10 Optimal Level of Product Availability  Homework #2  10\/13 \n9 10\/17 Exam 2 \u2013 Chapters 11 -13   \n10 10\/24 Transportation \/Guest Speaker    \n11 10\/31  Procurement and Sourcing    \n12 11\/7 Revenue Management \/Sustainability    \n13 11\/14 Sustainability Panel Discussion  \nCase 2 Review - 3M Case 2 Analysis  \nCase 2 Response  11\/10 \n11\/12 \n14 11\/21 Final Project Presentation s Case Study Paper  \nCase Study Presentation  \nHomework #3  11\/17 \n11\/19 \n12\/1 \n15 12\/12 Exam 3 - Chapters 14 -17 \u2013 5:00 \u2013 7:30 PM    \n16 12\/18  Academic Year Ends  \nGrades due by noon    \n ","course_title":"Operations Management","course_number":"6208","instructor":"Andrew Fraher","semester":"Fall 2024","section":""},{"link":"https:\/\/dsba.charlotte.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/719\/2024\/10\/DSBA-6211-Advanced-Business-Analytics-Fall-2024-Kexin-Zhao.pdf","filename":"DSBA-6211-Advanced-Business-Analytics-Fall-2024-Kexin-Zhao.pdf","parent":"https:\/\/dsba.charlotte.edu\/2024\/10\/10\/dsba-6211-advanced-business-analytics-fall-2024-kexin-zhao\/","title":"DSBA 6211 Advanced Business Analytics, Fall 2024 \u2013 Kexin Zhao","content":"DSBA\/MBAD 6211  Syllabus  Dr. Zhao  \n \n \n  Page 1  \n  DSBA  6211  U90 \nAdvanced Business Analytics  \nUNC Charlotte  \nFall 2024  \n \nInstructor:  Dr. Kexin Zhao  \nOffice:  351B Friday  \nEmail:  kzhao2@charlotte.edu  \nClass Hours:  Monday  5:30-8:15 pm \nClassroom:  CCB 801 Office Hours:  M 9:30-11:30 AM  \nTA Online Office Hours : T&R  2:30-3:30 PM \nTA\u2019s Zoom  (Ms. Siqi Guo) \nWebsite:  Canvas           \nCourse Description  \nThis course is designed to help students apply  business  analytics techniques to explore and analyze  \nvarious types of data, so they can find subtle and non -trivial relationships that are understandable, \nuseful, and executable to business owners. Managers in various functional areas can exploit v aluable \ninsights gained via fact -based decision -making  to achieve competitive advantages . Specific topics \ncovered in this course include  predictive modeling , text mining , forecasting , and survival analyses . This \ncourse uses a case approach and Python  is the main programming language .  \n \nLearning Objectives  \nThis course  aims at business managers, information professionals, data analysts, as well as general \naudience who are interested in applying data analytics techniques to discover non -trivial relationships \nand to summarize data in novel ways that are understandable, useful, and executable to business owners.  \n \nThis course will examine principles, ideas, and data analytics tools underlying the current practice of \nmachine learning . Specifically, students will understand basics of predictive modeling, survival \nanalyses, text mining , and forecasting . By und erstanding business analytics at  the practical and non -\nhighly -mathematical level, students  will be able to translate information into decisions and convert \ninformation about past performance into reliable forecasts.  \n \nThis course will develop understanding of practical applicability of analytics methods in a variety of \nbusiness scenarios.  This course  will not just describe\/explain the end results, but  also discuss the process \nof formulating\/refining business objectives, data selection, data preparation, model selection and \nevaluation that lead to the results.  The students will learn how to formulate analytic tasks in support of \nbusiness objectives, how to define successful projects, and how to evaluate utility of existing and \npotential applications of discussed technologies in practice.  \n \nThis course will take a case approach, complemented by lectures, seminar style discussion, and lab \nwork. This course will use Python  for hands -on experimentation with various analytics techniques.  \n \nCourse Materials  \nHandouts, power -point slides, assignments, and additional helpful resources will be posted on Canvas .  \n \nSoftware: Python\/Google Colab oratory  DSBA\/MBAD 6211  Syllabus  Dr. Zhao  \n \n \n  Page 2  \n  Recommended references : \n- Google Colab Overview:  https:\/\/colab.google\/  \n- Free Python  bootcamp course provided by the School of Data Science:  \nhttps:\/\/hia.charlotte.edu\/current -students\/sds -bootcamp -courses\/  \n \nGrading  \n \nComponent  Percentage  \nTwo exams (2 @ 27.5 %) 55% \nGroup project  25% \nAssignments ( 4 @ 5%)  20% \nTotal  100%  \nFinal letter grade will be calculated based on the following scale:  \nA: 90 and above; B: 80-89.9; C: 70 -79.9; D: 60 -69.9; E: 59.9 and below.  \n \nThe course grades are posted on Canvas  for informational purposes only. The official overall grade is \ncomputed and kept in the instructor\u2019s grade book.  \n \nExams  \nExams are  administered in class . Questions on the exams will be taken from the assigned readings of \ntexts, class lectures, and assignments.  \n \nIf the answer to an exam question is disputed, the student should submit a written appeal, citing the \nsource to the instructor. The instructor will take these appeals into account during grading.  \n \nExams are a form of intellectual property belonging to those who create them. Consequently, students \nCANNOT share exam content with anyone at any time . Sharing  an exam with anyone online or offline \nwill be considered theft of intellectual property.  Such action will result in an exam grade of zero and \nmay warrant further disciplinary action.  Exams will remain in my possession or under my control at all \ntime \n \nMissed exams  \nIn the event that the excuse is approved before the exam date  (a rare case and requires \ndocumentation), the student will be given a make -up exam.  \n \nAssignments  \nStudents need to complete four individual  assignments during the course of the semester. These \nassignments will be submitted on Canvas  before 11:59PM  on the due date . Assignments submitted \nafter the due date will be considered late. A penalty of 20% of the assignment value per day \n(including weekends) is assessed on late assignments beginning on the due date.  \n \nYou must complete each assignment on your own.  Any sharing between students will be considered a \nviolation of the Academic Integrity Code and will result at a minimum in a grade of zero for the \nassignment with a possibility for further disciplinary action.  \n DSBA\/MBAD 6211  Syllabus  Dr. Zhao  \n \n \n  Page 3  \n  All changes in assignments or sc hedules will be posted on Canvas . It is your responsibility to keep \nup with the c hanges that are posted on Canvas .  \n \nGroup Project  \n \nStudents will form a group of 3-5 members t o complete a business analytics  project. Detail s will be \nmade available via Canvas . If possible, all teams should be comprised of students from different \ndisciplines\/backgrounds, so please keep this in mind this when selecting your team members. I reserve \nthe right to arrange\/rearrange team assignments.  \n \nIf a group member does not contribute, the rest of the members may, after a consensus agreement, ask \nhim\/her to leave the group and notify the instructor. The maximum project grade for students not  \nbelonging to a group will be 80 .  If necessary, peer reviews will be factored into the grade.  \n \nNo more than 2 teams  could work on the same  dataset. The topic selection is first come , first serve d. \n \nClass Policies  \n \nLaptop Requirement  \nStudents are required to have their own personal laptop computer. The policy and the minimum \nsystem requirements are found at the link https:\/\/datascience.charlotte.edu\/current -\nstudents\/advising\/laptop -policy\/   \n \nAttendance and Participation Policy  \nAttendance and participation are required and tardiness or early departure is disruptive and is, of \ncourse, discouraged.  Students will be held responsible for any material covered, announcements \nmade, assignments passed out, and any other type of work that they may miss during any absence \nfrom class.  \n \nClass Behavior Policy  \nInappropriate behavior distracts the ability of others to profit from their in -class experience.  Such \nbehavior includes arriving late, leaving early, talking, surfing the net, and so on.    \n \nRude and inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated . Since it is my responsibility to provide an \nenvironment that is conducive to learning for everyone in the class, I will deduct points from the \ngrade of any student who chooses to repeatedly distract others.   In particularly egregious cases, I \nwill have the student permanently removed from the class.  \n \nUnder no circumstances will students be permitted to spend their class  time working on \nassignments for other classes, checking e -mail, surfing the Web, or printing out \nhomework.  Attempts to engage in such behavior will be reflected in lower grades and may lead to \nremoval from the course.  \n \nElectronic Devices in Class  \nUse of cellular phones, music players, radios, and similar devices are prohibited in the classroom \nand laboratory facilities.  Cellular phones MUST BE TURNED OFF DURING CLASS, except in \ncases of medical emergencies.  Use of computing devices for purposes other than those required for \nthe purposes of the class topic are prohibited.  This includes use of laptops, phones or other devices \nfor Internet browsing, game playing, reading news, texting, chatting, IM and other activities not \nrequired for the class.  \n DSBA\/MBAD 6211  Syllabus  Dr. Zhao  \n \n \n  Page 4  \n  Grade Appeals Policy  \nIf you believe that the grade you received on an assignment or an exam was in error or unfair, you \ncan appeal to the professor in writing within 7 calendar days after the grades are posted . The \nappeal should clearly state the reasons why you believe the grade to be unfair or the nature of the \nerror. Overdue appeals will not be considered.  \n \nAcademic Integrity  \nAs a program that helps to create business and government leaders, the School of Data Science  has \nan obligation to ensure academic integrity is of the highest standards.   Standards of academic \nintegrity will be enforced in this course.   \n  \nUniversity regulations will be strictly enforced in all cases of  academic irregularities, cheating or \nplagiarism or any variations thereof.   Students assume full responsibility for the content and \nintegrity of the academic work they submit. The guiding principle of academic integrity shall be \nthat a student's submitted work, examinations, reports, and projects must be his\/her own work.  \n  \nAll UNCC students have the responsibility to be familiar with and to observe the requirements of \nThe UNCC Code of Student Academic Integrity  (see the Catalog and \nalso http:\/\/integrity.charlotte.edu\/ ). This code forbids cheating, fabrication or falsification of \ninformation, multiple submission of academic work, plagiarism of written materials and software \nprojects, abuse of academic materials (such as library books on reserve), and  complicity in \nacademic dishonesty  (helping others to violate the code). Additional examples of violation of the \nCode include:   \n\u2022 Representing the work of others as your own.  \n\u2022 Using or obtaining unauthorized assistance in any academic work.  \n\u2022 Giving unauthorized assistance to other students.  \n\u2022 Modifying, without instructor approval, an examination, paper, record, or report for \nthe purpose of obtaining additional credit.  \n\u2022 Misrepresenting the content of submitted work.  \n \nStudents are expected to report cases of academic dishonesty they become aware of to the course \ninstructor who is responsible for dealing with them.  \n  \nFor this course, it is permissible to assist classmates in general d iscussions about the \nhomework.  General advice and interaction are encouraged. Each person, however, must develop \nhis or her own solutions to the assigned homework and laboratory exercises. Students may not \n\"work together\" on graded assignments. Such collaboration constitutes cheating, unless it is a \ngroup assignment. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) \nand represent it as his\/her own. If you need help on an assignment, contact your instructor or the \nTA, not other classmates.  \n  \nAny further specific requirements or permission regarding academic integrity in this course will be \nstated by the instructor, and are also binding on the students in this course.  \n  \nStudents who violate the code can be punished to the extent of being permanently expelled from \nUNCC and having this fact recorded on their official transcripts. The normal penalty is zero credit \non the work involving dishonesty and further substantial reduction of the course grade. In almost \nall cases, the course grade is reduced to \"F.\"   \n  DSBA\/MBAD 6211  Syllabus  Dr. Zhao  \n \n \n  Page 5  \n  If you are unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an honor code violation, you \nshould meet me to discuss the situation.   Feel free to discuss the definition of cheating and\/or \nplagiarism with me if you are unclear on these terms or have questions about the acceptability of a \nparticular type of action.  \n  \nThe instructor may ask students to produce identification at examinations and may require students \nto demonstrate that graded assignments completed outside of class are their own work.  \n \nDisability Accommodations  \nUNC Charlotte is committed to access to education. If you have a disability and need academic \naccommodations, please provide a letter of accommodation from Disability Services early in the \nsemester. For more information on accommodations, contact the Office of Disability Services at \n704-687-0040 or visit their office at Fretwell 230.  \n \nDiversity  \nThe School of Data Science  strives to create an inclusive academic climate in which the dignity of \nall individuals is respected and maintained. Therefore, we celebrate diversity that includes, but is \nnot limited to ability\/disability, age, culture, ethnicity, gender, language, race, religion, sexual \norientation, and socio -economic status.  \n \nIncomplete Grade Policy  \nReceiving a grade of incomplete (\u201cI\u201d) is not based solely on a student\u2019s failure to complete work or \nas a means of raising his\/her grade by doing additional work after the grade report time.  An \nincomplete grade can be given only when a student has a serious medical problem or other \nextenuating circumstance that legitimately prevents completion of required work by the due date.  \nIn any case, for a student to receive an 'I' grade, the student's work to date should be passing, he\/she \nmust have completed a significant portion of the course, and the student must provide proper \nwritten proof (e.g., a doctor's note) of the extenuating circumstances.  \n \nCourse Changes Policy  \nThe instructor reserves the right to make any necessary changes to the course content, schedule, \nand policies. Changes will be announced in class and will also be posted online.  \n \nReligious Accommodation for Students Policy  \nThe instructor will observe University Policy 409 ( https:\/\/legal.charlotte.edu\/policies\/up -409) on \nmatters of religious accommodation.   Please note that the procedure prescribed by this policy \nrequires a notice to the instructor prior to the census date of the semester (typically the tenth day of \ninstruction).  \n \n \n  DSBA\/MBAD 6211  Syllabus  Dr. Zhao  \n \n \n  Page 6  \n  Tentative  Class Schedule  \n*** This tentative schedule is subject to change ***  \n \nWeek  Date  Topics  Due Dates  \nWeek 1  Aug 19  \u2022 Couse I ntroduction  \n\u2022 Overview of Business A nalytics  \n\u2022 Brief Software Recap   \nWeek 2 Aug 26  \u2022 Predictive Modeling  Group formation due  \nWeek 3  Sep 2  Labor Day \u2013 No Class \u263a \nWeek 4 Sep 9  \u2022 Predictive Modeling  Project topic due  \nWeek 5 Sep 16  \u2022 Predictive Modeling   \nWeek 6 Sep 23  \u2022 Advanced Predictive Modeling  Assignment 1 due  \nWeek 7 Sep 30  \u2022 Dimension Reduction  Assignment 2 Due  \nWeek 8 Oct 7  \u2022 Midterm  \nWeek 9 Oct 14  Student  Recess  \u2013 No Class \u263a \nWeek 10 Oct 21  \u2022 Text Mining   \nWeek 1 1 Oct 28  \u2022 Text Mining  \n\u2022 Guest speaker: Dr. Colby T.

The goal is to help students find subtle and non -\ntrivial relationships that are understandable, useful, and executable to business ow ners. \nManagers in various functional areas can exploit valuable insights gained via fact -based \ndecision -making to achieve competitive advantages. Specific topics covered in this \ncourse include predictive modeling, text mining, forecasting, survival analyses, and \nexperimentation . This course uses a case approach and Python is the main \nprogramming language.  \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \nThis course is designed for business managers, information professionals, data \nanalysts, and the general audience interested in applying data analytics techniques. It \naims to explore non -trivial relationships, summarizing data in novel, practical, and \nexec utable ways that benefit business owners.  \nAt the end of the semester, students should  \n\u2022 Understand the principles, ideas, and data analytics tools underlying the current \npractice of data mining.  \n\u2022 Understand the basics of predictive modeling, experimentation, survival \nanalyses, text mining, and forecasting.  \n\u2022 Understand the practical applicability of analytics methods in various  business \nscenarios.  \u2022 Learn how to formulate analytic tasks in support of business objectives, how to \ndefine successful projects, and how to evaluate the utility of existing and potential \napplications of discussed technologies in practice.  \nThis course will take a case approach , complemented by lectures, seminar -style \ndiscussion, and lab work. This course will use Python for hands -on labs with various \nanalytics techniques.  \nCOURSE  MATERIALS  \n\u2022 Handouts, power -point slides, assignments, and additional helpful resources will \nbe posted on Canvas.  \n\u2022 Software: Python\/Google Colaboratory  \n \nGRADING  \nComponent  Points  \nTwo Exams (2)  50 \nAssignments ( 4) 20 \nPython Bootcamp   3 \nGroup Project   25 \nClass Participation  2 \nTotal  100 \nFinal letter grade will be calculated based on the following scale:   \nA: 90 and above, B: 80 -89.9, C: 70 -79.9, U: 69.9 and below.  \nThe course grades are posted on Canvas for informational purposes only. The official \noverall grade is  computed and kept in the instructor\u2019s grade book.  \nEXAMS  \nExams are closed  book  and notes , with questions sourced from assigned readings, \nclass lectures, and assignments. In the event that the excuse is approved before the \nexam date (a rare case and requires documentation),  the student will be given a make -\nup exam.  \nShould a student dispute an answer to an exam question, they are encouraged to \nsubmit a written appeal, citing their source, to the instructor. These appeals will be \nconsidered in the grading process.  \nExams are intellectual property and should be treated as such. They remain the \npossession of the course instructor  at all times and cannot be reproduced or distributed in any way. While students are encouraged to review their exams during virtual office \nhours or by appointment, any failure to respect the stipulated conditions, including \nunauthorized distribution or reproduction of the exam, will be considered as a breach  of \nintellectual property.  Such actions will result in an exam grade of zero and may lead to \nfurther disciplinary measures.  \nASSIGNMENTS  \nAssignments will be posted a minimum of one week before their due date, with solutions \nto be submitted exclusively via Canvas. Each assignment will include detailed \ninformation on the tasks involved and the expected deliverables.  \nUnless otherwise specified, assignments are due at the beginning of the class on the \nstipulated due date (5:30 pm). Any submissions made on the due date, but after the \nstart of class, will incur a 20% deduction from the total points earned. Assignments \nsubmitted after the due date may still be accepted but with a 50% penalty. If an \nassignment is not turned in before its grade is posted or a week after the due date, \nwhichever comes first, it will be scored as zero.  \nEach student must independently develop their solutions to the assigned homework. \nWhile exchanging ideas is encouraged, collaboration on homework assignments, unless \nexplicitly defined as a group task, is considered cheating. Students are prohibited from \nusing or copying someone else's work (or portions of it) and presenting it as their own.  \nDataCamp  \nFor class preparation, you are required to complete the SDS Python Bootcamp, a \ncustom track available on DataCamp ( https:\/\/www.datacamp.com\/ ). The School of Data \nScience (SDS) offers this bootcamp specifically to support students with weak \nfoundational skills in programming. If you do not have full access to DataCamp yet, \nplease visit https:\/\/dsba.charlotte.edu\/current -students\/sds -bootcamp -courses\/  and \nrequest access with your @charlotte.edu  email account.  \nIf you already have a DataCamp account (e.g., with your @uncc.edu  or personal email \naccount ) and wish to merge your data with the new account, follow the instructions here \n(How do I enroll my existing DataCamp account into my organization's group? )  \nATTENDANCE AND CLASS PARTICIPATION  \nStudents are expected to attend every class and remain in class for the duration of the \nsession. Failure to attend class or arriving late may impact your ability to achieve course \nobjectives which could affect your course grade.  An absence, excused or unexcused, \ndoes not relieve a student of any course requirement. Regular class attendance is a \nstudent\u2019s obligation, as is a responsibility for all the work of class meetings, including \ntests and written tasks. An y unexcused absence or excessive tardiness may result in a \nloss of participation points.  This course uses Canvas and other online learning supporting systems, which provides \nthe instructor with analytics and data on student engagement with the Canvas page, \nincluding page views, participation, submissions, timeliness, etc. I will be monitoring \nstudent activities on Canvas to ensure successful engagement and participation in the \ncourse. If I notice that a student's activities on Canvas indicate issues with \npedagogically appropriate engagement, I may reach out to the student to discuss \nimproving c ourse engagement and participation.  \nCLASS CONDUCT  \nI will take very seriously any distraction caused by violating the above policies. Any \nmember of the class should feel free to let me know if any behavior of fellow student(s) \nis distracting her\/his learning experience. Such complaints will be treated as c onfidential \nbut will help me to take appropriate action to provide a positive learning environment in \nthe class.  \n \nSince it is my responsibility to provide an environment that is conducive to learning for \neveryone in the class, I will deduct all participation points from the grade of any \nstudent who chooses to repeatedly distract others or create other disruptions. In \nparticularly egregious cases, I will have the student permanently removed from \nthe class and deduct up to a maxim um of 15% of the final grade. To attend or not \nto attend is your decision to make, but once you decide to attend my class, you \nshould refrain f rom any disruptive behavior during the class.  \n \nACADEMIC INTEGRITY  \nAll students are required to read and abide by the Code of Student Academic Integrity. \nViolations of the Code of Student Academic Integrity, including plagiarism, will result in \ndisciplinary action as provided in the Code. Definitions and examples of plagi arism are \nset forth in the Code. The Code is available from the Dean of Students Office or online \nat https:\/\/legal.charlotte.edu\/policies\/up -407. \nOwnership of Course Materials  \nThe lectures and course materials provided by the instructor including presentations, \ntests, quizzes,  exams, videos, outlines, and similar materials are protected by copyright. \nThe instructor is the  exclusive owner of copyright in those materials instructor creates. \nYou are encouraged to take notes  and make copies of course materials for your own \neducational use. However, you may not, nor you  may knowingly allow others to \nreproduce or distribute course materials publicly without instructor\u2019s  express written \nconsent. This includes providing materials to commercial course material suppliers  such \nas CourseHero , Chegg , etc. and other similar services . Students who publicly \ndistribute or  display or help others publicly distribute or display cop ies or modified \ncopies of the instructor\u2019s  materials may be in violation of University Policy - 406, the \nCode of Student Responsibility . GRADE APPEALS  \nIf you believe that the grade you received on an assignment, exam or other graded \ncourse component was in error or unfair, you can appeal to the professor in writing \nwithin 10 calendar days of the receipt of your grade. The appeal should clearly  state the \nreasons why you believe the grade to be unfair or the nature of the error. Overdue \nappeals will not be considered . \nINCOMPLETE GRADE POLICY  \nThe incomplete is not based solely on a student\u2019s failure to complete work or as a \nmeans of raising his\/her grade by doing additional work after the grade report time. An \nincomplete grade can be given  when a student has a serious medical problem or other \nextenuating circumstance that legitimately prevents completion of required work by the \ndue date.   In any cases, the student's work to date should be passing, and the student \nshould provide proper written proof (e.g., a doctor's note), in order to  get an 'I'  grade.  \nDISABILITY ACCOMMODATIONS  \nUNC Charlotte is committed to access to education. Students in this course seeking \naccommodations to disabilities must first consult with the Office of Disability Services \nand follow the instructions of that office for obtaining accommodations.

Software: Python\/Google Colab Notebooks  Recommended references: \u2022 Google Colab Overview: https:\/\/colab.research.google.com\/?utm_source=scs-index  \u2022 Free Python bootcamp course provided by the School of Data Science: https:\/\/datascience.charlotte.edu\/current-students\/sds-bootcamp-and-training-course\/  \u2022 There are no required textbooks as students will be provided with enough materials for each topic on Canvas. But, you may find the following text useful to further your knowledge in analytics and data science: o \u201cAn Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python\u201d by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Taylor (free pdf download available at https:\/\/www.statlearning.com\/)  o \u201cData Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking\u201d by Provost and Fawcett, ISBN-13: 978-1449361327  Laptop Requirement  All students taking classes from the Belk College of Business and\/or the School of Data Science are required to have their own laptop computer. If you are using a work laptop, please make sure that your laptop can access the webpages and other materials posted on Canvas and that there are no network access restrictions installed by your workplace.  If so, you may find having your personal laptop saves a lot of issues relating to doing work in class.     \n3   Grading2:  Component Points Exams (2 x 250 points) Group Project & Presentation Assignments (4 x 50 points) Class participation & Attendance 500 points (50%) 250 points (25%) 200 points (20%)   50 points (5%)  Final letter grades will be based on the following total points at the end of semester:  900 and above  A (Superior Performance) 800-899.99   B (Good Performance)  700-799.99   C (Marginal Performance) Below 700   U (Unsatisfactory)   Credit Hours This is a 3-credit hour course. Thus, the course has been designed to require on average about 10 hours\/week (about 3 hours outside of class for every 1 credit hour) between readings, quizzes, and assignments\/project work. Of course, the hours may be more or less than indicated above depending on the assignments, cases, exams or project work due.  If a student has limited backgrounds in certain topics, they might need to spend additional time to keep up with other students in the course.   Attendance Students are expected to attend all class meetings and to arrive before the class starts. Class topics are integrated, with each week building on prior weeks. Failure to arrive on time or attend class can adversely affect individual performance, ability to contribute to class discussion, in-class assignments, and the earned letter grade. If a student misses 4 or more classes, they will automatically receive an unsatisfactory U grade in the course regardless of earned points to date on other activities. If a student misses a class due to work or other reasons, it is their responsibility to get notes from peers; instructors do not hold extra repeat class sessions.  Also, there will be no make-up for in-class assignments given irrespective of whether your absence is excused or un-excused.    Class Participation  Class attendance will be taken at random in class during the semester. A student\u2019s attendance percentage based on this random attendance is factored into the final grade for class participation. Students are strongly encouraged to have active participation in class discussions. I expect every student to read the textbook and other posted materials prior to each live session.     2 Any changes to the grading components or weights will be at the discretion of the instructor and will be communicated to the students well in advance.   \n4   Exams There will be two exams. Exams are closed book and notes when they are administered in class. Exams may require LockDown Browser, which will be specified in advance by the instructor. Exam questions will not be accessible after you take the exams. The instructor will keep all exams. However, exam reviews are available during office hours or by appointment for 10 days after exam grades are posted. All exam grades will be posted on Canvas.  No exam reviews are allowed after 10 days after the grades are posted.  Exams are intellectual property and should be treated as such. They always remain the possession of the course instructor and should not be reproduced or distributed in any way. Any failure to respect the stipulated conditions, including unauthorized distribution or reproduction of the exam, will be considered as a breach of intellectual property. Such actions will result in an exam grade of zero and may lead to further disciplinary measures.  Missing an exam without prior approval and\/or providing supporting documentation within the following timeframe will lead to a grade of zero for that exam. If the excuse is approved before the exam date (in rare case and requires supporting documentation), the student will be given a make-up exam. A student who misses an exam without prior approval, possibly due to unexpected situation on the exam day, should contact the instructor within 12 hours of the exam start date\/time and provide appropriate supporting documentation to be eligible for a makeup exam. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to be aware of and follow the make-up exam policies and no special accommodations will be made for any exceptions. No makeup exam will be given after the last day of class.   Group Project Students will form a group of 3-4 members to complete a business analytics project. Details will be made available via Canvas. If possible, all teams should be comprised of students from different disciplines\/backgrounds, so please keep this in mind this when selecting your team members. I reserve the right to arrange\/rearrange team assignments.  If a group member does not contribute, the rest of the members may, after a consensus agreement, ask him\/her to leave the group and notify the instructor. Peer reviews will be implemented and factored into the grade.  Assignments  All assignments are posted on Canvas and should be submitted on Canvas.  Unless specified by instructor, assignments emailed to the instructor will not be accepted.  Assignments submitted after the due date\/time but within 24 hours of the due date\/time will be graded with a 25% penalty of the original grade. Assignments submitted after 24 hrs of the due date\/time will receive a grade of zero.  No exceptions are allowed for this late policy.  Also, this late policy applies only to homework assignments and not to in-class assignments, quizzes and exams.      \n5   Unless the assignment clearly specifies otherwise, you must complete each assignment on your own. Any sharing of answers between students or submitting someone else\u2019s work as your own will be considered a violation of the Academic Integrity Code and will result in, at a minimum, a grade of zero for the assignment with a possibility for further disciplinary action.   Quizzes & In-class Assignments There will be short quizzes at various points in the semester on topics covered before. There may also be in-class assignments. Once an exam\/quiz has started and work has been collected, late arrivals cannot make them up. (If one arrives during a quiz, they can immediately start on it, but no time extension will be given). Make-up quizzes or in-class assignments are not allowed irrespective of whether your absence is excused or un-excused.  Instead, one quiz or in-class assignment out of all administered quizzes & in-class assignments will be dropped for the final grading.  Since the class meets on Tuesdays evening, please arrange your work or personal activities around this schedule.  Extra Credit Opportunities Descriptions of extra credit opportunities, if any, will be offered to the entire class and posted on Canvas.  However, it is strongly encouraged that students do not rely on extra credit to improve their grades as we may end up with very few or no extra credit opportunities in the semester.  No extra credit will be offered to an individual student for the purpose of improving her\/his grades.  Bottom line:  Stay focused throughout the semester and do not miss any assignment or test, so you don\u2019t have to rely on extra credit for improving your grades.  Class Behavior Policy  I will conduct this class in an atmosphere of mutual respect. I encourage your active participation in class discussions. Each of us may have strongly differing opinions on the various topics of class discussions. The presentation and discussion of different ideas are encouraged and welcome. The orderly questioning of the ideas of others, including mine, is similarly welcome. However, I will exercise my responsibility to manage the discussions so that ideas and argument can proceed in an orderly fashion. You should expect that if your conduct during class discussions seriously disrupts the atmosphere of mutual respect I expect in this class, you will not be permitted to participate further.   Under no circumstances will students be permitted to spend their class time working on assignments for other classes, checking e-mail, or surfing the Web. Attempts to engage in such behavior will be reflected in lower grades and may lead to removal from the course.  All students and the instructor are expected to engage with each other respectfully. Unwelcome conduct directed toward another person based upon that person\u2019s actual or perceived race, actual or perceived gender, color, religion, age, national origin, ethnicity, disability, or veteran status, or for any other reason, may constitute a violation of University Policy 406, The Code of Student Responsibility. Any student suspected of engaging in such conduct will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct.   \n6     Civility The University strives to create an inclusive academic climate in which the dignity of all individuals is respected and maintained. We celebrate diversity that is beneficial to both employers and society at large. Students are strongly encouraged to be respectful and courteous towards others when sharing their views during class discussions.  Academic Integrity\/Honesty Students have the responsibility to know and observe the requirements of The UNC Charlotte Code of Student Academic Integrity available online at http:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/up-407. This code forbids cheating, fabrication or falsification of information, multiple submissions of academic work, plagiarism (which includes viewing others work without instructor permission), abuse of academic materials, and complicity in academic dishonesty.  This forbidding includes sharing\/copying work between individuals or teams without permission of instructors. Any special requirements or permission regarding academic integrity in this course will be stated by the instructor, and are binding on the students.  Students who violate the code can be expelled from UNC Charlotte.  The normal penalty for a first offense is zero credit on the work involving dishonesty and further substantial reduction of the course grade.  In almost all cases the course grade is reduced to failing.  Students are expected to report cases of academic dishonesty to the course instructor.   Grade Appeals  If you believe that the grade you received on an assignment, exam or other graded course component was in error or unfair, you can appeal to the professor in writing within 10 calendar days of the receipt of your grade. The appeal should clearly state the reasons why you believe the grade to be unfair or the nature of the error. Overdue appeals will not be considered.   Incomplete Grade Policy  The incomplete is not based solely on a student\u2019s failure to complete work or as a means of raising his\/her grade by doing additional work after the grade report time. An incomplete grade can be given when a student has a serious medical problem or other extenuating circumstance that legitimately prevents completion of required work by the due date. In any case, the student's work to date should be passing up to the time of the extenuating circumstance, and the student should provide proper written proof (e.g., a doctor's note), in order to get an 'I' grade.   Disability Accommodations UNC Charlotte is committed to access to education. If you have a disability and need academic accommodations, please provide a letter of accommodation from Disability Services early in the semester. For more information on accommodations, contact the Office of Disability Services at 704-687-0040 or visit their office in Fretwell 230.      \n7   Accommodations for Religious Observances  UNC Charlotte provides reasonable accommodations, including a minimum of two excused absences each academic year, for religious observances required by a student\u2019s religious practice or belief.  Please refer to https:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/up-409 for details on requesting such accommodations.  Other Information c Students are responsible for all announcements made in class or announced via email. The instructors may send some information via Canvas announcements. It is the students\u2019 responsibility to keep up-to-date on the class-related information and to check their @uncc.edu email regularly.   c The instructors will discuss grades only in person (and not via telephone or e-mail) and only with the student (not with parents, spouses, etc). The instructors may not answer student e-mails about exam grades other than related to scheduling appointments. Office hours are posted on the class home page on Canvas.  c The instructors may modify the class schedule and syllabus during the course of the semester depending upon the progress of the class.   The University of North Carolina Charlotte and the Belk College of Business strive to create an inclusive academic climate in which the dignity of all individuals is respected and maintained. Therefore, we celebrate diversity that includes, but is not limited to ability\/disability, age, culture, ethnicity, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socio-economic status.

Catalog Description Network Science helps students design faster, more resilient communication networks; revise infrastructure systems such as electrical power grids, telecommunications networks, and airline routes; model market dynamics; understand synchronization in biological systems; and analyze social interactions among people. It examines the various kinds of networks (regular, random, small-world, influence, scale-free, and social) and applies network processes and behaviors to emergence, epidemics, synchrony, and risk. This course integrates concepts across computer science, biology, physics, social network analysis, economics, and marketing.   Prerequisites Consent of the Instructor   Course Objectives Networks are all around us, including natural and man-made systems. Examples include rivers, trees, arteries, highways, brain, economy, social connections, military, energy distribution, cyber attacks, terrorist networks, epidemics, Internet, and Facebook. Students will learn (a) the basic principles, concepts, and principles of networks; (b) how and why network structures and properties determine the performance and sustainability of any system; (c) how to measure and evaluate network-based systems; (d) how to utilize networks for the benefit of their organizations and society; and (e) how to utilize and design tools for understanding, visualizing, and applying the principles of networks.    Teaching Strategies Materials presented in this course will be covered through lectures, projects, and in-class exercises. Every topic will be covered in the following: class, class preparations, in-class conversations among students, and project-based hands-on experience. In the end, students will have both the theoretical understanding of network concepts and concrete experience of putting such concepts and principles into practice.

The project consists of the following elements: \u2022 problem definition, \u2022 description of nodes and edges in the project, \u2022 description of the data and data sources needed for the successful implementation of the project, \u2022 selection of the tool chosen for network implementation, \u2022 network analysis covering concepts presented in the class, including: network visualization, centrality measures, clustering, homophily, network components, distributions of various network metrics, randomness, and principles of network formation, \u2022 in-class presentation, \u2022 PowerPoint presentation, and \u2022 programming code and data.   Students can choose a project of their own, or ask the instructor for help with the project selection.   A project team may include up-to two students. Project deliverables include an in-class presentation, a PowerPoint description of all aspects of the projects, programming code, and data used in the project. All students must participate in the project definition, network and data preparation, network analysis, PowerPoint preparation, and in-class presentation. In-class presentations must identify each student\u2019s contribution to the project.   There will be two project presentations in-class, one mid-term and one in the final week of the class. The midterm presentation will not be graded. Its purpose is to help students with the network definition and analysis.   Students will be graded on: \u2022 The clarity of project definition (10% of the project grade) \u2022 Appropriateness of data and data sources for the project (20%) \u2022 Extent of network analysis (30%) \u2022 PowerPoint presentation (20%) \u2022 Clarity of in-class presentation (20%)   Attendance Students are expected to attend all class meetings online or in person and to arrive before the class starts. Class topics are integrated, with each week building on prior weeks. Failure to attend or to arrive on time can adversely affect both individual performance, ability to contribute to the group project, and the earned letter grade. If a student misses a class due to work or other reasons, it is their responsibility to get notes from peers; instructors do not hold extra repeat class sessions.     Students will be allowed to miss no more than 3 classes without affecting their final grade. For every 3 absences the final grade will be lowered by one letter grade.   UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE AND DEPARTMENTAL POLICIES University Policies  Code of Student Responsibility: \u201cThe UNC Charlotte Code of Student Responsibility (the Code) sets forth certain rights and responsibilities in matters of student discipline.  The Code defines these responsibilities and guarantees you certain rights that ensure your protection from unjust imposition of disciplinary penalties.  You should familiarize yourself with the provisions and procedures of the Code\u201d (Introductory statement from the UNC Charlotte brochure about the Code of Student Responsibility).  The entire document may be found at this Internet address: http:\/\/legal.uncc.edu\/policies\/ps-104.html   Academic Integrity All students are required to read and abide by the Code of Student Academic Integrity. Violations of the Code of Student Academic Integrity, including plagiarism, will result in disciplinary action as provided in the Code.

It focuses on helping students to develop quantitative analytical \nskills valuable for a wide range of business fields, especiall y on how data analysts describe, \npredict, and inform business decisions . As with the new developments of information technology \nand advancements in analytical tools, the strategic decision making at corporate level  is \nwitnessing a shift away from intuitive decision making to data -analytics based decisions. \nCompanies are increasingly competing on analytics and are in need for people with both \nmanagerial expertise and analytical skills. This course intends to help stu dents develop these \nskills.  \nThis course is designed to help MBA students to move from qualitative to quantitative decision \nmaking  focusing on consumer -related problems and  (for students with data analytics skills) to \nexpand their professional and academic abilities in consumer related topics. It not only \nintroduces students to a variety of business  decision models, but also teaches them how to \nestimate these models using statistical software ( \/Excel ), and how to apply them for decision \nrecommendations. Spec ifically, this course will introduce a variety of quantitative models to \nimprove business  decision making in such areas as customer segmentation, customer targeting, \nbrand positioning, as well as pricing and promotion decisions.  \nPrerequisites:  \nAn introduc tory class in statistics\/regression and working knowledge of MS Excel. Experience in \nany form of computer programming is always a plus but not required. However, the single most \nimportant prerequisite for the class is a positive attitude towards learning.  \nStudents are expected to have basic computer skills including using the Internet, specifically, the \nWeb. Students should be able to interact with the course site and resources in Canvas (posting to \nCanvas discussion board, submitting assignments, etc.). We  will be using Microsoft Excel  \n(including Excel Solver and the Analysis. The minimal technical skills required include the ability \nto: \n\u2756 organize and save electronic files  \n\u2756 find and use web resources  \n\u2756 use email and attach files  \n\u2756 check email and Canvas  daily  \n\u2756 download and upload documents via email and Canvas   \n\u2756 prepare reports using a word processor  \n\u2756 create and modify spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel  \n\u2756 use basic spreadsheet functions and manipulate data.  \nClass Hours:  \nMondays : 12:30pm \u2013 3:15pm (Session 001)  \nMondays:  5:30pm \u2013 8:15pm  (Session 002)  \n \nCourse Objectives and Approach:  \nThis is a hands -on and application -orientated course  embracing  the principle of learning by doing . \nEach  analytic model  that we cover ha s software ( advanced Excel ) implementation , and  a \nproblem\/case whose resolution can be enhanced through the use of data . Statistical tools covered \nin the class will range from simple data analysis and visualization, to advanced methods such as \nnon-linear regressions, choice model , and mining of \u2018unstru ctured \u2019 data. Our emphasis will be on \napplications and interpretation of the results for making business\/policy decisions. To master each  \nmajor tool introduced in this course,  students  should go through  a four -stage problem solving \nprocess : analyz ing the business problem, selecting and estimating  relevant models, interpret ing \nestimation results, and making  decision recommendations.  To master this four-stage problem \nsolving process, students are expected to struggle at times. Notably, a major requireme nt is that \nstudents apply analytics techniques to their group pro ject to solve typical business decision  \nproblems of their own choice. The semester -long project is intended to train students for the four-\nstage process of problem solving.  \nRegardless of your  prior background, focus of this course should be on  continuous improvement  \nby benchmarking your own progress. In particular, you will get most of this class by focusing on \n(a) removing your fears (if any) of data analysis, (b) enhancing your toolkits, and  (c) (most \nimportantly) internalizing the broad analytical intuition.  \nThe content of the course is covered through lectures and the students \u2019 own efforts. Materials \npresented in class are a blend of the topics covered in the textbook and other sources.  \nClassroom  Rules \n\u2756 Please keep an eye on your UNCC email, as I will communicate with you through it as \nwell as visit the course website periodically to download the hand -outs, assignments and \nother course materials.  \n\u2756 If you experience any technical issues in o ur online environment, reach directly to the IT \nService Desk at: Phone: 704 -687-5500 Email: help@uncc.edu Webpage: \nhttps:\/\/help.uncc.edu\/  \u2756 Electronic video, image capture, and\/or audio recording is not permitted during class, \nwhether conducted in person or online, unless the student obtains permission from the \ninstructor.

The details about how to \ninstall this software are provided in Appendix to this syllabus.  \n\u2022 Course material  \nPresentation slides and other course materials will be available for download from your personal \nUNCC Canvas account, accessible at http:\/\/canvas.un cc.edu\/ for all registered students. Course \nmaterial will be posted periodically on the course page (UNCC Canvas) as we progress through \nthe course. All the grades on homework and exams will be available on your Canvas account. \nStudent are required to chec k their UNCC email ID and Canvas for important notifications.  \nGrading Scale:  \nEvaluation  \n \nHomework Assignments  200 \nIndividual\/Group Project  250 \nWeekly Checkup Questions  150 Exam I  200 \nExam II  200 \nBonus points for posting and answering fellow \nstudents \u2019 questions on Canvas  Proportional \nto number \nand quality \nof postings  \n \nTotal  1000+  \n \nHomework Assignments (20%):  There will be multiple exercises throughout the semester. In each \nexercise, students are expected to solve specific business  analytics problems relevant to \ncorresponding lectures.  \nGroup Project (25%): One group project will be assigned. The case is a small group assignment. \nYou may work in groups of 3-4 people (It is acceptable to work individually.) All members of a \ngroup will receive the same grade.  \nHow to find team members : There are several ways for you to consider finding team members.  \no First, you may reach out to people you know in the class to for m a team.  \no Second, you may use the \u201cDiscussions \u201d board on Canvas to communicate with your peers \nto find teammate(s) or join a team.  \no Any other ways.  \nSince members of a group receive the same grade, I do not force the team formation. If you cannot \nfind a teammate, you will have to do it individually (which is totally doable). One team only needs \nto submit ONE copy of work to Canvas for grading.  It is each team member \u2019s responsibility to \nensure his\/her name is on the file  (For team members who do not contri bute, other members have \nthe right not to include their names in the report. They then have to work out and submit their own \nwork to earn the grade ). Grade will not be granted if your name is not on the file.  \n \nClass Attendance (15%): You are expected to go over all the course materials and actively \nparticipate in class discussions. Class participation (both quality and frequency) accounts for 15% \nof your final course grade and is used to reward students for positively contributing to the class \nlearning environment. Details will be  discussed in class.  \n\u2022 1% for introduce your self  \n\u2022 4% for rewarding  (finish all the checkup questions and actively participate in class sessions)  \n\u2022 10% for Weekly Checkup Questions  \nIndividual Canvas  Exams  (40%):  The exams will cover short exercises pertaining to each topic \ncovered and will be similar in spirit to the case studies\/exercises covered in the class. The exams \nare open  book  and open  notes  (not open internet) . \n\u2022 Exam I will be given during regular class m eeting time. The final exam  (Exam II)  will be \nadministered according to the UNCC Final Examination Schedule. Exams will be open  \nbook and open  notes. You will complete each exam on Canvas. Only one attempt is \nallowed for each exam.  \n\u2022 Note that these exams are  timed, and it is urged that you study the required materials carefully before the exam.  \n\u2022 Exams have to be your individual work and any form of collaboration is not allowed. \nSharing, emailing, or copying answers will be considered academic misconduct. Any \nexams not taken on the scheduled day require a written note (e.g., doctor \u2019s note) \ncertifying your inability to take the exam on the scheduled date and time.  \n\u2022 Exams will cover homework and lecture notes consistent with the tentative class \nschedule. The forma t of the exams will be multiple -choice and will include conceptual \n(e.g., non -mathematic) problems as well as problem -solving and numeric manipulation.  \n\u2022 Make -ups for exams may be requested for valid excuses only. All excuses must have \nverifiable documentation. Foreseeable excuses (e.g. athletes on traveling squads) must be \ndocumented and requests be received at least one week in advance of the exam. If you \nmiss the final exam for a legitimate reason, you will be given an \u201cIncomplete \u201d and a \nmakeup final will be arranged accordingly. A student missing a test with an unexcused \nabsence will receive a score of zero.  \n \nTurning in Homework and Projects:  All written projects and assignments should be submitted \nelectronically via canvas on the due date. 20% of the assigned grade will be deducted for the late \nassignments \/each day till reach 0 point.  \nGrading scale:  \nYour overall numerical grade will be rounded to the nearest integer and then converted to a letter \ngrade according to the following table. Once the  course grades are released, requests without clear \nevidence for a change would be denied.  \n \nLetter Grade  A  B  C  D  F  \nRange of Numerical Grade  90+  [80, 89]  [70, 79]  [60, 69]  < 60  \n \nWhen You Need Help  \nPlease reach out to me if you have any questions about course material or difficulties with the \nconcepts. This includes questions during class, office hours or appointments, by e -mail, before you \nhand in assignments, and after you receive your grade. I am on your team. Your preparation and \nwillingness to interact with me really helps to keep us on track and in tune with each other during \nthe lecture sessions.  \n \nComments on Examinations, Homework, and Attendance:  \n\u2022 All homework and tests will be delivered and submitted through Canvas.   \n\u2022 Homework : It will be assigned on Canvas . Each student should work on the assignments \nindependently . Further details on the assignments are forthcoming. You are expected to \nsubmit on or before the due date. No excuse for late submission will be considered. No late \nhom ework will be accepted.

It focuses on helping students to develop quantitative analytical \nskills valuable for a wide range of business fields, especially on how data analysts describe, \npredict, and inform business decisions . As with the new developments of information technology \nand advancements in analytical tools, the strategic decision making at corporate level  is \nwitnessing a shift away from intuitive decision making to data -analytics based decisions. \nCompanies are increasingly competing on analytics and are in need for people with both \nmanagerial expertise and analytical skills. This course intends to help stu dents develop these \nskills.  \nFocusing on consumer -related problems , this course is designed to help DSBA  students with \nanalytic skills to link quantitative  analytic tools to business strategic decision making, and to \nhelp MBA students to move from qualitative to quantitative decision making . This course will \nassist all students in expanding their professional and academic abilities in consumer -related \ntopics . It not only introduces students to a variety of business  decision models, but also teaches \nthem how to estimate these models using statistical software ( Excel ), and how to apply them for \ndecision recommendations. Specifically, this course will introduce a variety of quantitative \nmodels to improve business  decision making in such areas as customer segmentation, customer \ntargeting, brand positioning, as well as pricing and promotion decisions.  \nPrerequisites:  \nAn introductory class in statistics\/regression and working knowledge of MS Excel. Experience in \nany form of computer programming is always a plus but not required. However, the single most \nimportant prerequisite for the class is a positive attitude towards  learning.  \nStudents are expected to have basic computer skills including using the Internet, specifically, the \nWeb. Students should be able to interact with the course site and resources in Canvas (posting to \nCanvas discussion board, submitting assignments, etc.). We will be using Microsoft Excel  \n(including Excel Solver and the Analysis. The minimal technical skills required include the ability \nto: \n\u2756 organize and save electronic files  \n\u2756 find and use web resources  \n\u2756 use email and attach files  \n\u2756 check email and Canvas  daily  \n\u2756 download and upload documents via email and Canvas   \n\u2756 prepare reports using a word processor  \n\u2756 create and modify spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel  \n\u2756 use basic spreadsheet functions and manipulate data.  \nClass Hours:  \nMondays : 12:30pm \u2013 3:15pm (Session 001)  \nMondays:  5:30pm \u2013 8:15pm  (Session 002)  \n \nCourse Objectives and Approach:  \nThis is a hands -on and application -orientated course  embracing  the principle of learning by doing . \nEach  analytic model  that we cover ha s software ( advanced Excel ) implementation , and  a \nproblem\/case whose resolution can be enhanced through the use of data . Statistical tools covered \nin the class will range from simple data analysis and visualization, to advanced methods such as \nnon-linear regressions, choice model , and mining of \u2018unstructured\u2019 data. Our emphasis will be on \napplications and interpretation of the results for making business\/policy decisions. To master each  \nmajor tool introduced in this course,  students  should go through  a four -stage problem solving \nprocess : analyz ing the business problem, selecting and estimating  relevant models, interpret ing \nestimation results, and making  decision recommendations.  To master this four-stage problem \nsolving process, students are expected to struggle at times. Notably, a major requirement is that \nstudents apply analytics techniques to their group pro ject to solve typical business decision  \nproblems of their own choice. The semester -long project is intended to train students for the four-\nstage process of problem solving.  \nRegardless of your prior background, focus of this course should be on  continuous improvement  \nby benchmarking your own progress. In particular, you will get most of this class by focusing on \n(a) removing your fears (if any) of data analysis, (b) enhancing your toolkits, and (c) (most \nimportantly) internalizing the broad analytical intuition.  \nThe content of the course is covered through lectures and the students\u2019 own efforts. Materials \npresented in class are a blend of the topics covered in the textbook and other sources.  \nClassroom  Rules \n\u2756 Please keep an eye on your UNCC email, as I will communicate with you through it as \nwell as visit the course website periodically to download the hand -outs, assignments and \nother course materials.  \n\u2756 If you experience any technical issues in our online environment, reach directly to the IT \nService Desk at: Phone: 704 -687-5500 Email: help@uncc.edu Webpage: https:\/\/help.uncc.edu\/  \n\u2756 Electronic video, image capture, and\/or audio recording is not permitted during class, \nwhether conducted in person or online, unless the student obtains permission from the \ninstructor.

In each \nexercise, students are expected to solve specific business  analytics problems relevant to \ncorresponding lectures.  \nGroup Project (25%): One group project will be assigned. The case is a small group assignment. \nYou may work in groups of 3-4 people (It is acceptable to work individually.) All members of a \ngroup will receive the same grade.  \nHow to find team members : There are several ways for you to consider finding team members.  \no First, you may reach out to people you know in the class to form a team.  \no Second, you may use the \u201cDiscussions\u201d board on Canvas to communicate with your peers \nto find teammate(s) or join a team.  \no Any other ways.  \nSince members of a group receive the same grade, I do not force the team formation. If you cannot \nfind a teammate, you will have to do it individually (which is totally doable). One team only needs \nto submit ONE copy of work to Canvas for grading.  It is each team member\u2019s responsibility to \nensure his\/her name is on the file  (For team members who do not contribute, other members have \nthe right not to include their names in the report. They then have to work out and submit their own \nwork to earn the grade ). Grade will not be granted if your name is not on the file.  \n \nClass Attendance (15%): You are expected to go over all the course materials and actively \nparticipate in class discussions. Class participation (both quality and frequency) accounts for 15% \nof your final course grade and is used to reward students for positively contributing to the class \nlearning environment. Details will be  discussed in class.  \n\u2022 2% for introduce your self  \n\u2022 4% for rewarding  (finish all the checkup questions and actively participate in class sessions)  \n\u2022 9% for Weekly Checkup Questions  \nIndividual Canvas  Exams  (40%):  The exams will cover short exercises pertaining to each topic \ncovered and will be similar in spirit to the case studies\/exercises covered in the class. The exams \nare open  book  and open  notes  (not open internet) . \n\u2022 Exam I will be given during regular class meeting time. The final exam  (Exam II)  will be \nadministered according to the UNCC Final Examination Schedule. Exams will be open  \nbook and open  notes. You will complete each exam on Canvas. Only one attempt is \nallowed for each exam.  \n\u2022 Note that these exams are timed, and it is urged that you study the required materials \ncarefully before the exam.  \u2022 Exams have to be your individual work and any form of collaboration is not allowed. \nSharing, emailing, or copying answers will be considered academic misconduct. Any \nexams not taken on the scheduled day require a written note (e.g., doctor\u2019s note) \ncertifyi ng your inability to take the exam on the scheduled date and time.  \n\u2022 Exams will cover homework and lecture notes consistent with the tentative class \nschedule. The format of the exams will be multiple -choice and will include conceptual \n(e.g., non -mathematic) problems as well as problem -solving and numeric manipulation.  \n\u2022 Make -ups for exams may be requested for valid excuses only. All excuses must have \nverifiable documentation. Foreseeable excuses (e.g. athletes on traveling squads) must be \ndocumented and requests be received at least one week in advance of the exam. If you \nmiss the final exam for a legitimate reason, you will be given an \u201cIncomplete\u201d an d a \nmakeup final will be arranged accordingly. A student missing a test with an unexcused \nabsence will receive a score of zero.  \n \nTurning in Homework and Projects:  All written projects and assignments should be submitted \nelectronically via canvas on the due date. 20% of the assigned grade will be deducted for the late \nassignments \/each day till reach 0 point.  \nGrading scale:  \nYour overall numerical grade will be rounded to the nearest integer and then converted to a letter \ngrade according to the following table. Once the course grades are released, requests without clear \nevidence for a change would be denied.  \n \nLetter Grade  A  B  C  D  F  \nRange of Numerical Grade  89+  [80, 89]  [70, 79]  [60, 69]  < 60  \n \nWhen You Need Help  \nPlease reach out to me if you have any questions about course material or difficulties with the \nconcepts. This includes questions during class, office hours or appointments, by e -mail, before you \nhand in assignments, and after you receive your grade. I am on your team. Your preparation  and \nwillingness to interact with me really helps to keep us on track and in tune with each other during \nthe lecture sessions.  \n \nComments on Examinations, Homework, and Attendance:  \n\u2022 All homework and tests will be delivered and submitted through Canvas.   \n\u2022 Homework : It will be assigned on Canvas .

The main \ndifference of this new medium is that consumers have a \nshare of voice , which makes this channel a different \nlandscape for  firms .  \nThis course starts with an overview of this new paradigm , \nand covers  topics related to developing social media strategy  \nand implementing the ir respective tactics with marketing \nand business goals in mind. In specific, it covers following topics  (1) Traditional media vs. social media  (2) Social \nmedia strategies and objectives  (3) Social platforms (4) \nSocial Advertising (5) Influencer Marketing.  In addition to the  substantive and strategic aspects of social \nmedia marketing , we also cover  many analytics methods \nrelated to the social media data such as (1) social listening \nand text analytics , (3) social metrics and regression analysis, \n(4) social segmentation and cluster analysis, and (5) social \nnetwork and network analytics.  \nCourse Objectives  \n\uf0a7 Articulate business goals for social media.  \n\uf0a7 Develop social media content strategy.  \n\uf0a7 Differentiate between social channels and their \napplications. \n\uf0a7 Propose an advertising strategy and evaluate its effectiveness.  \n\uf0a7 Develop an influencer marketing plan using the \nconceptual framework of influencer marketing.  \n\uf0a7 Develop a framework for social media marketing \nanalytics.  \n\uf0a7 Analyze data using analytical methods applicable to social media data.  \nCourse Structure  \nThis is a fully  online asynchronous course. In this course, \nthere are seven  modules pertaining to each week. In each \nmodule, there are four components : read, watch, assignment,  \n2 \n and reflect. The reading component is a combination of \narticles and case studies. The watch component is a series of \nvideos . The assignment component includes both individual \nand team assignments, and the refle ct component includes \npeer review of other students\u2019 assignments as well as participating in a discussion board. Here is the breakdown of  \nthe activities  in this course  and their weights. \nTasks  Points  \nKnowledge Check ( related to the video lectures ) 240 \nWeekly Individual Assignments  300 \nCase Study - Group Assignment  300 \nPeer Review of Individual Assignments  50 \nDiscussion Board  (20 pts for post & 10 pts for reply) 90 \nIntroduce Yourself  10 \nIn-take Survey  10 \nTotal  1000  \nMaterials  \nThe assigned reading for each week is posted on Canvas  and \ncan be accessed through the library with the exception of one  \nHBR  article , which students  should be able to access for free . \nIn addition, we are going to use t he following HBR course \npack  for case studies, and can be purchases at : \nhttps:\/\/hbsp.harvard.edu\/import\/1200722 \nModule  Release Time \nThe instructor will release each module on Monday 00:00 and the assignments  of each module are due on Sunday \n23:59. There is only one exception, that is \u201cPeer Review of Weekly Assignments\u201d, which is due on Thursdays  23:59. Knowledge Checks  \nThis component of the course evaluates the learning goal s of \nthe lectures  through quizzes. Some of the quizzes are \nprovided as a separate assignment and should be completed after watching the videos, but some are embedded onto the videos and the questions are displayed while watching the lectures.  \nWeekly Assignments \u2013 Individual  \nUpon watching the videos, students should complete an \nassignment related to the topic of the module.  In the first four \nmodules , these assignments are mostly related to strategic \nissues in social media marketing, and in the last  three  \nmodules, they are mostly related to analytics methods of \nsocial media data.  \nPeer Review of Weekly Individual A ssignments  \nUpon completion of individual assignments, which are due \nby the end of each module , the instructor will randomly \nassign students\u2019  assignments to be reviewed by other \nstudents. These reviews are anonymous and are based on the \nprovided rubric. Reviewers also need to add comments in \ntheir evaluation . Please note that the instructor is the one \nwho is giving the final grade to the assignments and these \npeer reviews are going to be used during the evaluation \nprocess.  \nStudents should avoid mentioning their names in the assignment  text o r filename  since the assignments need to \nremain anonymous for peer review.  \n  \n3 \n Case Study \u2013 Team  \nStrating from module 2, in addition to the individual \nassignments, there are case studies that should be completed \nby a team of students . The se are Harvard Business Cases and \nstudents should purchase them to read and evaluate . \nFollowing that, they have to answer questions that were \nposted by the instructor  for each case study .  \nEach team should arrange between themselves to finish the assignment  by its due date. Teams  are formed by the \ninstructor  during the first week of classes.  \nCase Study \u2013 Peer Evaluation  \nUpon completion of the case study in each module , students \nshould also submit a peer evaluation of their teammates and  \nrate other members on a 0- 100 scale, in terms of the effort , \ncontribution, and communication in  submitting  the \nassignment. This peer evaluation has to be done by the end of module as well. The final score of the case study for each student will be a multiplication of the peer evaluation score and the assignment score. \nDiscussion Board  \nStarting from module 2, there are going to be weekly discussion topics that are posted by the instructor and \nstudents may wish to participate and share their ideas and opinions. Students should post at least three times  to the \ndiscussion board, and also respond to other student\u2019s\n posts \nat least three times . All these six discussion board \ncontributions should be in different modules.  \n Late Work Policy  \nAssigned work is due on the day  and time  indicated in the \nschedule. Students can submit their work late but only up to 24 hours after the due date, with the penalty of 1% deduction \nper hour late. For late submission more than 24 hours, \nstudents can request a late submission of the assignments only one time in this course, and it has to be requested before the deadline and the instructor also needs to approve it before the deadline. The instructor will also communicate the new due date with the student, which cannot be more than 3 days \nfrom the due date of the assignment. In any other scenario other than above, it will be counted as a no submission. \nComputation  \nThe instructor demonstrates analytics and visualizations \nprimarily  in R-Studio. This open- source software is freely \navailable for download, and you can find manuals and \ninstallation  guidelines on its website  site. We have videos in \nthe first few modules to get you started on this Software .  \nAlso, in order to have a uniform experience in R -Studio, you \ncan use Apporto, which is a cloud- based software platform  \nprovided by the University. There is a video in the first module that shows how to access and use it.  \nFew Additional Points \n\uf0a7 Responses to the assignments have to be uploaded to Canvas directly using a Microsoft word or Adobe PDF file, and online  submission of other forms such as Google \nDocs is not accepted.   \n4 \n \uf0a7 The instructor will grade the assignments according to the \nprovided rubric for each assignment. \n\uf0a7 The instructor will hold office  hours by appointment. \nAcademic Integrity  \nStudents have the responsibility to know and observe the \nrequirements of The UNC Charlotte Code of Student Academic Integrity.

The final deadline for all the deliverables is the last class.  \n \nAcademic Integrity  \nThe UNC Charlotte Academic Integrity Policy will be followed. The student is responsible for reading \nand understanding the policy: Students have the responsibility to know and observe the requirements of \nThe UNC Charlotte Code of Student Academic Integrity . This code forbids cheating, fabrication or falsification \nof information, multiple submissions of academic work, plagiarism, abuse of academic materials, and \ncomplicity in academic dishonesty. Any special requirements or permission regarding academic inte grity in \nthis course will be stated by the instructor, and are binding on the students. Academic evaluations in this \ncourse include a judgment that the student\u2019s work is free from academic dishonesty of any type, and grades \nin this course therefore should be and will be adversely affected by academic dishonesty. Students who \nviolate the code can be expelled from UNC Charlotte. The normal penalty for a first offense is zero credit on \nthe work involving dishonesty and further substantial reduction of the cour se grade. In almost all cases the \ncourse grade is reduced to F. Copies of the code can be obtained from the Dean of Students Office. Standards \nof academic integrity will be enforced in this course. Students are expected to report cases of academic \ndishones ty to the course instructor.  \nBelk College of Business Statement of Diversity  \n The Belk College of Business strives to create an inclusive academic climate in which the dignity of all \nindividuals is respected and maintained. Ther efore, we celebrate diversi ty that includes , but not limited to \nability\/disability, age, culture, ethnicity, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socio -\neconomic status.  \nNon -discrimination in the classroom  \nAll students and the instructor are expected to engage w ith each other respectfully.   Unwelcome conduct \ndirected toward another person based upon that person\u2019s actual or perceived race, actual or perceived gender, color, \nreligion, age, national origin, ethnicity, disability, or veteran status, or for any other  reason, may constitute a \nviolation of  University Policy 406, The Code of Student Responsibility . Any student suspected of engaging in such \nconduct will be referred to the Office of Student Conduc t. \nUniversity Policies on Withdrawals   \n \n \n5  Students are expected to complete all courses for which they are registered at the close of the add\/drop \nperiod.   If you are concerned about your ability to succeed in this course, it is important to make an appointment to \nspeak with me as soon as possible. The University policy on withdrawal allows students only a limited number of \nopportunities available to withdraw from courses.   It is important for you to understand the financial and academic \nconsequences that may result from  course withdrawal . \n \nUniversity\u2019s statement on Disability  Accommodations  \nUNC Charlotte is committed to access to education.

These policies and \nexpectations are intended to create a productive learning atmosphere for all students. Unless you \nare prepared to abide by these policies and expectations, you risk losing the opportunity to \nparticipate further in the course.  \nDescription:  \nThe Internship is an opportunity for students to apply theories, ideas, principles, and skills learned in the classroom to a project of problem solving in practice . Using the internship site as \nthe \u201corganizational laboratory,\u201d students further develop skills for becoming data science or analytics professional. The internship experience is about understanding data science, business, and health analytics needs and practices within an organizational context, including their culture, computing and management systems, operations, resources, products, services, markets, service areas, and specialty areas. The internship is about blending your skills together from all of your classes to produce and communicate an outcome and conclusion.   It is not  about any specific \ncourse or class you have taken or whether you have built the absolute best model.   A specific \nindividual at the selected organization, referred to as the mentor (or preceptor), is expected to provide internship project supervision and act as a point of contact. The experience is obtained in organizations approved by the Program under the guidance of a UNC Charlotte faculty supervisor and a qualified mentor at the selected organization.  \n Course Competencies:  \nAfter successfully completing this course, students should be able to:  \n1. Identify the purpose and risks  of solving a data analytics problem; strategies should \nincorporate perspec tives of various stakeholders and be responsive to our increasingly \ndiverse workforce and society.  \n2. Develop project tasks  that are concrete and feasible to solve a data analytics problem.  \n3. Use appropriate data analytics tools, interpret the results, and defend their analysis . \n4. Demonstrate effectiveness in organizing, synthesizing, and articulating ideas and information for various stakeholders in both written and oral communication.  \n5. Articulat e and model professional and ethical behavior  in the workplace.  \n6. Demonstrate effectiveness in working with others  in the organization, and the ability to \nwork effectively with personnel from diverse backgrounds. \n7. Demonstrate effectiveness in working as part of a team , listening, and responding \neffectively to the ideas of others, and successfully use negation and conflict resolution skills.  \nCourse Conduct and Professional Responsibility:  \nThe internship serves as an extension of the teaching mission of the Sch ool of Data Science, by \ngiving students work experience in the type of organization or research environment in which they will eventually pursue careers.  While serving in graduate internships, students are \nrepresentatives of the Programs. As such, they wi ll act with total professionalism at all times. \nStudents participating in internships are required to meet the standards of and comply with the \npolicies and procedures of their workplace, such as attire standards and work hours. While at work, students should ensure their level of effort and contribution to the work environment meet (and preferably exceed) sponsor expectations. \nInternship Requirements:  \n\u2022 Fundamental Aspects \u2013 Internship objectives and activities must clearly address \ntwo fundamental aspects. T hese aspects must be demonstrated unequivocally in all \nsetup, documentation, and reporting. \n      For DSBA:  \n1. Applied DSBA Techniques - First, there must clearly be a significant component of \napplying Data Science and\/or Business Analytics techniques. This m ay involve \ndesign, implementation, or analysis, but it should represent some tangible advancement of data science and business analytics systems or outcomes for the organization. For \nexample, data entry is certainly an essential part of analytics, and may be very important for an organization, but itself would not represent a significant component of analysis or data science experience on the part of the student.  Whereas developing an underlying \ndatabase from domain requirements analysis, user interface vis ualizations for others \nperforming data entry, or developing novel predictive analysis and reporting capability from historical outcomes using an existing data warehouse, would represent a significant DSBA development.  \n2. Domain Content Understanding - Second, the project must clearly involve learning about \nthe application domain to develop understanding of and direct relevance to the primary domain of expertise of the organization or unit. For example, many data Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) activities may  involve significant development work, \nbut may focus only on limited knowledge about the pre\u2010defined structure \/ types of data, \nrather than the semantics and relevance of the important domain concepts underlying that \ndata. Whereas developing an internal web\u2010based dashboard tool for analysis of business \nrecords would require an understanding of many of the domain concepts and how they \ninteract, in order to realize such a system.  \n      For HIA  \n1. Applied HIA Techniques - First, there must clearly be a significan t component of \napplying Health Informatics Analytics techniques from your introductory courses . \nThis may involve database design, implementation, or analysis, but it should represent some tangible advancement of health informatics and analytics systems or outcomes for the organization. he internship experience also provides students an opportunity to gain understanding of healthcare organizations, their culture, management systems, operations, resources, products, services, markets, service areas, and speci alty areas. \nUsing the internship site as the \u201corganizational laboratory,\u201d the student further develops skills for becoming a Health Informatics and Analytics professional. As life-long learners \nand practitioners, students will continue to develop and grow their knowledge, skills, \nprofessionalism, and competence.  \n2. The practice experience occurs in healthcare organization carefully selected by the student and approved by the course instructor. Students are encouraged to select an internship position based on t heir career interests.   Our expectation is that the preceptor \nmentors and guides the student.   The course instructor may be used for additional support \nand guidance. \n\u2022 Internship Proposal - A short formal proposal describing the proposed internship context ( organization, role) and activities (objectives, high - level tasks). This should be \ndetailed enough for program staff to understand how the proposed internship activity will meet the fundamental aspects. The focus of the setup proposal is on a higher -level position description and what will be accomplished in the internship. The link to the internship proposal form may be found here  for DSBA and here\n for HIA. For any \ninternship that is at a healthcare organization or is unpaid (except for those conducted at UNC Charlotte), there are likely more requirements. Please see the \nthis site  for additional \ndetails.     \n\u2022 Letter of Agreement - A letter documenting participation of the organization in the internship program must be signed by the mentor\/preceptor or another responsible official from the organization where the student will be doing the internship. The mentor agreement letter will be sent to the mentors\/preceptors by the instructor, TA, or for HIA internships by Julie Howell, and must be provided directly to Program administration from the respective organization officials to verify approval. \n\u2022 Internship Project Plan \u2013 Precise activities are typically defined at the start of an internship. A brief project plan (2 -3 pages containing specifics beyond the setup proposal) detailing objectives, ex pected tasks, and outcomes to be accomplished during \nthe internship must be developed by the student in consultation with the mentor\/preceptor and participating organization. Within the first two weeks of the internship, each student needs to meet with the internship mentor and, using the syllabus as a guide, articulate more specific objectives and proposed tasks for the internship. The focus of the project plan is on more specific work tasks and how internship activities will proceed (work packages, expected timeframes, etc.). Most often, the project plan will include a Gantt Chart with a task numbering system. Please review Canvas for the due date.  \n\u2022 Progress Reporting - The student must submit regular progress reports\/updates, as determined by the UNC Charlotte supervising faculty (typically every two weeks). These will refer back to the Project Plan and task numbers to align update to the project plan. Dates are in the Canvas site.  \n\u2022 Required Hours - Students must complete a minimum of 160 hours internship experience with the selected organization during the semester of enrollment in the Internship course. Internship organizations may require more hours than the program minimum as part of a specific internship offering, and the student must meet that organizational obligation. \n\u2022 Final Report - The student must write a report (10 to 12 pages) detailing the internship experience; details about the report are described later in the syllabus.  \u2022 Final \/ Interim Presentation - The student must present a final summary of internship \nexperience at an Internship Reports session for program staff and students.  \n\u2022 Post-Internship Mentor Evaluation - After the internship is complete a representative \nof the participating organization, ty pically the mentor, will provide a post -internship \nevaluation of the student\u2019s performance. This evaluation will be considered as a substantial input for the course grade.  \n\u2022 Post -Internship Student Evaluation - After the internship is complete the student w ill \nprovide a post -internship evaluation of the experience.  \n\u2022 Final Grade - UNC Charlotte supervising faculty will evaluate the student\u2019s overall performance in the internship to assign the course grade.  \nEvaluation and Grading:   \n\u2022 Activity plan, progress reports, and peer evaluations, submitted in a timely fashion. 10%  \n\u2022 Final Presentation and Report: 90%  \n\u2022 20% will be deducted per day assignment is late (except for Final Report which is at discretion of the instructor):  \n\u2022 DSBA: 70% is necessary to receive a P (pa ss) grade. \n\u2022 HIA: Graded A = > 90%; B >80%, C>70%, U < 70%. \nImportant Deadlines:  \nThe following items need to be submitted to the program\/UNC Charlotte supervising faculty according to the general schedule that follows. Specific deadlines may be set or amend ed by the \nsupervising faculty and are generally available in Canvas.   For internships that start before or \nafter the normal semester start date, a written plan with revised due dates must be submitted by \nthe student and approved by the supervising faculty.  \n\u2022 Internship Setup Proposal \u2013 due prior to registration for the targeted semester  \n\u2022 Signed Agreement with organization\/mentor \u2013 approximately two weeks after internship \nstart date (Instructor will send this to your Mentor listed in your proposal). \n\u2022 Activity P lan, in collaboration with the mentor upon starting at the organization, two \nweeks after internship start date  \n\u2022 Progress reports\/updates to UNC Charlotte supervising faculty, every two weeks after \nActivity Plan submission  \n\u2022 Internship Presentation, as sched uled for presentation sessions; final presentation after \ninternship is complete and before the end of the registered semester  \n\u2022 Internship Final Report, after internship is complete, before end of registered semester  \n\u2022 Post-Internship Student Evaluation of Internship experience, after internship is complete, \nbefore end of registered semester  \n\u2022 Post-Internship Mentor Evaluation of Student, after internship is complete, before end of \nregistered semester  \nRole of Mentor\/Preceptor:  The mentor\/preceptor is a specif ic individual at the internship organization who provides \ninternship project supervision and acts as a point of contact with the DSBA program. The \nmentor\/preceptor is expected to take on the following responsibilities to support the internship experience.   \n1. The mentor\/preceptor is responsible for the student\u2019s activities and learning during the internship experience.  \n2. The mentor\/preceptor serves as a supervisor and advisor for the students to observe and \nadvise the student routinely. The mentor is the primary judge of the impact of the work to \ntheir business.  \n3. The mentor\/preceptor may periodically consult with responsibl e faculty on the student\u2019s \nprogress. \n4. The mentor\/preceptor completes a student evaluation form at the end of the internship \nexperience.  \nRole of Supervising Faculty:  \nThe supervising UNC Charlotte faculty member and teaching assistants are the liaisons between \nthe student, mentor\/preceptor, and the SDS Programs. The supervising faculty member and teaching assistants may assist in the selection of participating organizations and maintain communication with the student and mentor throughout the internship exper ience. Supervising \nfaculty members and teaching assistants are selected by the SDS Programs.   \nInternship Evaluations and Report:  \nAt the end of internship semester, each organization and student will evaluate the experience \nusing an evaluation rubric prov ided by the SDS Program. These assessments must be received by \nprogram administration in order to receive a grade in this course. To demonstrate accomplishment of concrete objectives and assure accountability during the field experience, as well as providi ng measurable benefits to the organization, each student intern is required to \ndevelop a report.  You have the freedom to write the report as your mentor would like to see it.  However, please add commentary on your experience as outlined in the Appendix of the \nfollowing potential outline of an acceptable report.  \n1. Title Page: Give your internship project a concise, professional, descriptive title. Include the title, the course number, the semester (e.g., Spring 2022), your name, and the names of your faculty advisor and your mentor.  \n2. Table of Contents  \n3.

Describe how the internship or your preparation for it might be improved  \nProcedures for Approval to Take the Internship Course:  \nAn Internship must be approved by the program prior to enrollment, guided by the requirements articulated below. A permit to register for the internship course will be provided only after the \nfollowing have been complied with:  \n1. Student has confirmed with program administration their intent to complete an internship \nat least a semester prior to the time the internship is to occur.  \n2. Student  secures a suitable internship opportunity.  \n3. Student works with the internship organization to develop an internship setup proposal, which must be submitted and approved by program administration. The setup proposal must clearly address the fundamental technical and domain aspects. The proposal must be submitted to and approved by program administration well in advance of the semester during which the internship is to occur.  4. Receipt by program administration of a letter of agreement signed by the \nmentor\/preceptor or another responsible official from the organization where the student will be doing the internship. The mentor\/preceptor agreement letter must be provided directly to SDS Program administration from the respective organization officials to verify approval.  \n5. If required by the internship organization, the student may need to provide evidence that they have had immunizations for DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) or TD (tetanus, diphtheria), MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and polio or poliomyelitis, submit results of a recent TB test, and provide evidence of at least starting the process for taking a Hepatitis B vaccination or submit a letter refus ing to take the Hepatitis B vaccine series.  \n6. If required by the internship organization, a student must have a drug screen test and a criminal background check completed before an internship course permit can be issued. Please note that the student is respo nsible for keeping and maintaining records of their \ndrug screen test and background check and to have these available when requested by the agency. Additional requirements such as CPR training may also apply.  \nObtaining an Internship:  \nWe expect SDS student s to explore internship options through opportunities provided through \nthe program, including:   \n\u2022 Industry Professionals you have met through the program, such as guest speakers;  \n\u2022 Networking events such as the bi - annual SDS Advisory board meetings;  \n\u2022 SDS facul ty affiliates and part time SDS faculty members;  \n\u2022 Recent alumni, particularly SDS students who graduated in the previous year;  \n\u2022 Your classmates.  \nNetworking effectively is an essential skill for all professionals. Using your own initiative will help you develop important skills and help you to obtain an internship that is a closer fit with your professional interests and succeed in your career. Whil e the program may facilitate \nintroductions to internship opportunities, it is the responsibility of the student to obtain an internship that will satisfy the requirements of this course.  \nCourse Policies  \nSyllabus Changes:  \nThe standards and requirements set forth in this syllabus may be modified at any time by the course instructor. Notice of such changes to this syllabus posted on the course Canvas website. \nAttendance:  \nStudents are required to attend the presentations sessions at the end of the semester.   There may \nbe one or more optional sessions throughout the semester where the students may ask clarifying \nquestions or the faculty may provide additional guidance.  Students are required to work directly with their instructors regarding final presentation abs ences \nfor medical appointments, military\/court orders, and\/or personal and family emergencies, such as \na death in the immediate family, where a student is able to provide an instructor with appropriate supporting documentation of the absence. The final decision for approval of absences and missed work or make-up work is determined by the instructor. \nThe Office of Student Assistance and Support Services (SASS) can provide notification to \nfaculty of emergency situations, when a student is unable to do so and when the office has been made aware of such emergencies. In such situations, the SASS office may also be able to assist with verification of such emergencies, once a student is able to return to classes. The SASS office does not provide verification of absences for car trouble, weather issues, personal activities, work, weddings, vacations, or University-sponsored events. Absences related to such activities should be discussed directly with the faculty member.  \nShould a student need assistance from the SASS office in verifying an emergency situation, they can submit an online request form\n and attach supporting documentation. Please note that students \nare not required to go through the SA SS office at any time regarding absence verification, and \nthe SASS office does not have the authority to excuse absences, allow for make-up work, or provide other academic accommodations. \nIn cases of absence due to pregnancy or parenting (pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery from any of these conditions), students should contact the Title IX Office to obtain absence verification by completing the form at http:\/\/bit.ly\/332eaGd\n. \nGrade Discussions:  \nThe instructor will discuss grades only in person (and not via telephone or e-mail) and only with the student (not with parents, spouses, etc). Office hours are listed above. \nCredit and Time Expectations: This three credit course requires a minimum of 160 contact hours with you internship \norganization.  You may exceed this in many cases.   \nElectronic Devices:  \nStudents are not allowed to use any electronic devices during the class, unless otherwise instructed by the instructor. \nInclement Weather:  \nUniversity Policy\n states the University is open unless the Chancellor announces that the \nUniversity is closed. The inclement weather hotline number to call is 704 -786-2877. In the event \nof inclement weather, check your email and NinerAlerts . The instructors generally only cancel \nclass if the University is closed.  Self-Help:  \nIt is common for college students to experience challenges that may interfere with academic \nsuccess such as academic stress, sleep problems, juggling responsibilities, life events, relationship concerns, or feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, or depression. If you or a friend is struggling, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Helpful, effective resources are available on campus at no additional cost.  \n\u2022 Visit the Counseling and Psychological Services website at  caps.charlotte.edu  for \ninformation about the broad range of confidential on-campus mental health services, online health assessments, hours, and additional information. \n\u2022 Call CAPS at (704) 687-0311 if interested in scheduling an appointment with a counselor.

This includes providing materials to commercial course material suppliers such as CourseHero, Chegg, and other similar services. Students who publicly distribute or display or help others publicly distribute or display copies or modified copies of an instructor's course materials may be in violation of University Policy 406, The Code of Student Responsibility.  Similarly, you own copyright in your original papers and exam essays. If I am interested in posting your answers or papers on the course web site, I will request your written permission. \nAbsences  \nWhile this course has not set times, except for the final presentation, students are encouraged to \nwork directly with me regarding absences for medical appointments, military\/court orders, and\/or personal and family emergencies , such as a death in the immediate family, where a \nstudent is able to provide an instructor with appropriate supporting documentation of the absence. The final decision for approval of absences and missed work or make-up work is determined by the instructor.   Missing the final presentation will require coordination and may \nend up with the student receiving and incomplete until this can be arranged with me.   If you are \nable, it always much easier to present that day. It will be run through Zoom.  \nCode of Student Responsibility:  \n\u201cThe UNC Charlotte Code of Student Responsibility  (the Code) sets forth certain rights and \nresponsibilities in matters of student discipline.   The Code defines these responsibilities and \nguarantees you certain rights that ensure your protection from unjust imposition of disciplinary penalties.   You should familiarize yourself with the provisions and procedures of the Code\u201d (Introductory statement from the UNC Charlotte brochure about the Code of Student \nResponsibility).  The entire document may be found here . \nAcademic Integrity:  \nAll students are required to read and abide by the Code of Student Academic Integrity. Violations of the Code of Student Academic Integrity, including plagiarism, will result in disciplin ary action as provided in the Code. Definitions and examples of plagiarism are set forth \nin the Code. The Code is available from the Dean of Students Office or online. \nFaculty may ask students to produce identification at examinations and may require students to \ndemonstrate that graded assignments completed outside of class are their own work.  \nStudents should select unique subject areas for the Adapting Visualizations homework.  If by chance more than one student chooses the same original visualization, modified visuals shall be unique enough for the grader to easily determine that the students worked independently. Please use care in selecting visuals to ensure uniqueness from other students.   Students should also not \nselect visuals from Data Storytelling s ites or books where before and after visualizations are \nalready provided. Instructor may ask student to reattempt homework if there is any perception of violation.  If a second homework is perceived to be in violation, the student will receive a 0 for that homework. \nSpecial Needs:   \nIf you have a documented disability and require accommodation in this course, contact Disability \nServices, Fretwell 230, phone: 687 4355 voice\/TDD) the first week of the semester.  Information about available services may be foun d at Office of Disability Services\n. Accommodations for \nlearning will be arranged by that office and communicated to the Instructor.  If you speak English as a second language, please inform the instructor.  \nDiversity Statement:  \nUNC Charlotte strives to create an academic climate in which the dignity of all individuals is respected and maintained.   Therefore, we celebrate diversity that includes, but is not limited to \nability\/disability, age, culture, ethnicity, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socio -economic status.  \nAll students are required to abide by the Sexual Harassment Policy  and the \nStandard for \nResponsible Use of Information Resources . Sexual harassment, as defined in the UNC Charlotte \nSexual Harassment Policy, is prohibited, even when carried out through computers or other electronic communications systems, includi ng course-based chat rooms or message boards. \nReligious Accommodation: \nIt is the obligation of students to provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of religious \nobservances on which they will be absent by submitting a Request for Religious Accommodation  to their instructor prior to the census date for enrollment for a given semester.  The census date \nfor each semester (typically the tenth day of instruction) can be found in UNC Charlotte\u2019s \nAcademic Calendar . \nFood Insecurity:  \nFood insecurity is defined by the USDA as \u201ca lack of access to enough food for an active, healthy life.\u201d Food insecure categories include: reduced caloric in take, reduced food quality, lack \nof variety in diet, disrupted eating patterns, and hunger. Research shows that college students experience food insecurity at higher rates than the American household rate, and that food insecurity can negatively impact academic performance and persistence. In recognition of this problem, UNC Charlotte offers assistance to students facing food insecurity through an on- campus food pantry. The Jamil Niner Student Pantry (JNSP) is located on the east edge of campus at 1224 John Kirk Road. It has regular hours which may change from semester to semester; please see the website at https:\/\/ninerpantry.charlotte.edu\/\n for schedule and details on \nits services, as well as resources abo ut hunger and food insecurity among college students. \n ","course_title":"Internship","course_number":"6400","instructor":"Doug Hague","semester":"Spring
